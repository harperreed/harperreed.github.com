<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/2138986573/" title="Me and the bunny by nata2, on Flickr"><img align="right" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2030/2138986573_9e5a217b62_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Me and the bunny" /></a>My brother has been making these awesome little monsters out of socks for a little while. They are pretty cool and quite cute. I recently noticed that his <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5066104">etsy site</a> was somehow a bit incomplete - so i thought about what made some of the <a href="http://shawnimals.com/">other creature makers</a> creatures successful. I decided that key was the stories the awesome story about each character and monster really added a lot of personalization to the various creatures. Like shawnimal and his <a href="http://ninjatown.com/">ninjatown</a> people. totally compelling story.

So i suggested this to dylan and BAM. he made a whole universe. Pretty awesome.

<a href="http://www.dylanreed.org/2008/01/10/my-etsy-shoppe-and-the-stories-i-tell/">Check out his post about it</a>. But more importantly, <a href="http://awesomeguy.etsy.com/">buy some of the little friends he made</a>!
