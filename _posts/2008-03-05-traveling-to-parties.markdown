<p>I will be in Colorado tomorrow for <a href="http://techcocktail.com/home/2008/02/07/tech-cocktail-boulder-1/">Tech Cocktail Boulder</a>. It will be awesome to be a part of this event in Boulder. I will be officially representing <a href="http://skinnycorp.com">skinnyCorp</a> - so come get some swag and hang out! For those that have never been to a Tech Cocktail, it is a meet up style event mixing "cocktails" and technology. It offers a great opportunity to meet some of your local technologist, entrepreneurs and other awesome people in the boulder community. It seems that Boulder has a rich startup community being fostered by some <a href="http://coloradostartups.com/">cool</a> <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/">guys</a> - so it should be interesting to see what happens with Tech Cocktail. </p>
<p>Then on Sunday I will be at the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/430139/">SxSWi Party by Moo, Etsy, Timbuk2 and Threadless</a>. Its going to be pretty sweet. Come hang out and drink free beer. According to the upcoming attendee listing, it is going to be packed - so come early. </p>
<p>If anyone would like to meet up (i.e. boulder tech people), feel free to <a href="http://harperreed.org/contact">send me an email</a> or hit me up on a chat machine. </p>
<p>I will see you guys there!</p>
