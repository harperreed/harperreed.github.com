Apparently for the last month or two, I totally forgot that i have a blog. Instead of blogging, i have been hanging out with Hiromi, using twitter,traveling, programming and building things. I didn't have time to include blogging into that mix.

I have a theory, that when my twitter usage goes up, my blogging goes down (I am not <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/12/does-twitter-distract-from-or-inspire-your-blogging/">alone in this</a>). I am a bit annoyed by this. My twitter posts don't have as much reach as my blog posts. My interaction with people on twitter is much higher than on my blog. I am so conflicted. haha. Luckily, i think i can do both without sacraficing (much) one or the other.I think i will have to just make my posting smaller and more frequent (like a tumble log - but bigger) and make sure that i don't spend myself entirely on twitter.
