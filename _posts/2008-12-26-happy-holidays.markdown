I have been busy. Threadless just ended its <a href="http://www.threadless.com/news/400348/Tees_from_5_at_Threadless_Annual_Holiday_Sale">annual holiday sale</a> (went out with a <a href="http://www.threadless.com/news/406990/And_the_final_gift_is_opened_to_reveal">bang</a>). <a href="http://hiromiusagi.com">Hiromi</a> and I have been busy getting read for our holiday party with my parents on christmas (today!) and i have been hacking on a bunch of stuff in my spare time. Hiromi made an amazing dinner and we ate it. ;) It was a great time. We missed <a href="http://dylanreed.com">Dylan</a> and <a href="http://photodork.org/">Sarah</a>, but we will hopefully see them soon.

This year has been great thus far and I will attempt to memorialize it in a year end post around the 1st. However, in the meantime I wanted to take a moment and say "<a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/509/HI">HI</a>" and go ahead and wish everyone a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_greetings">Happy Holidays</a>. I hope everyone discovered their proper amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption">conspicuous consumer</a>. I know that <a href="http://reedbooks.org/">we</a> did.

Although, I certainly don't update my blog quite as often as I would like (or my mom would like) - I do update my <a href="http://twitter.com/harper">twitter status</a> quite often and post a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo">number of pictures to flickr</a>. I am hopefully going to start updating this blog a bit more, but in the meantime you are welcome to check out my <a href="http://harperreed.org/activity/">interweb activity aggregation page</a> and the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/HarperReedsActivityDigest">associated RSS feed</a> (props to <a href="http://derek.broox.com">broox</a> who showed me <a href="http://derek.broox.com/today">his</a>, which I copied).
