So lately i have been holed up in my apartment. i pry myself out for work and the occasional club siting, but mostly i stay in. I don't mind too much. i do mind missing concerts though. and i have found that i continually miss concerts. last night i missed the killers, the other day i missed death from above and i constantly miss shit. LAME. 

last night i came home and went to bed. hah. slept like 12 hours. rule. it is so needed sometimes. 

my book is awesome. 

my new site is awesome. 

ok.

i am off.
