here are some pics I took with my cameraphone and my laser. the <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera&img=823124740.jpg">first one</a> is me in my bedroom the laser is being scanned across my chest. the second is a <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera&img=823128708.jpg">swirl</a> being projected on my book shelf. <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera&img=823133700.jpg">the third</a> is what happens when you shine a 5mW laser into a really poor digicam. the fourth is the laser being <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera&img=823181316.jpg">swirled on my servers</a>.. <br/><br/>the green laser is incredible at night. the star pointing part of it is so insane. I bet you could touch a cloud. I am <a href="http://www.nata2.info/pictures/harper/me/IMG_0206.JPG">the terminator</a>.
