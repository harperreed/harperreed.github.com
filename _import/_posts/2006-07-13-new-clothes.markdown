So for awhile i have been paying attention to the <a href="http://www.bape.com/">BAPE</a>/<a href="http://www.zugara.com/bbc/">BBC </a>phenomona that is invading hiphop. I guess i should say it has invaded hiphop. Anyway. I have admired the all over print, crazy foil, insane patterned hoodies and shirts for far too long. I am going to try and acquire some stuff that is insane. INSANE i tell you.

<img align="right" title="Rogue Status" alt="Rogue Status" src="http://static.flickr.com/65/187996848_c09499c0d9_m.jpg" />so first i started talking to hiroki about all this nonsense. He was telling me how much money people are spending on this shit. Its amazing. 700 dollars for a monster looking BAPE Baby Milo hoody if you are IN TOKYO. wtf. I don't quite understand - i mean.. at <a href="http://www.skinnycorp.com">skinnycorp</a> one of our lines is <a href="http://www.nakedandangry.com">naked and angry</a> and the whole deal is that it is limited. but there is no way we are as off the hook as this whole patterned hip hop craze is. I am very interested in how they tell the story of limited. yea know. how do they make their lines appear soo limited?

so yea. i decided to buy an all over print shirt - so i got this <a href="http://roguestatus.com">rogue status</a> shirt. it is awesome. i purchased it from <a href="http://subdivisioninc.com/">subdivision</a> in vancover. check it out.
