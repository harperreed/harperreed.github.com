so I have been thinking up this journal entry for a couple days. I entered it yesterday - but I reboot my server and then was like.. hey I will press submit and lost it in the resulting downtime.. ugh.<br/>anyway.. I have a theory. it is this: so bush declared terror level orange and now their are security dogs on the blue line at all times. I think the two are related.. <br/>so it isn't a very good theory. maybe that is why I wan't ever to post it. a better theory is the one about the space shuttle blowing up. It is that bush knew the space shuttle was goign to have problems and rather then fix it he let it explode to overshadow his foreign policy problems. and then he uses the explosion to start the mars exploration <a href="http://www.lunaranomalies.com/prometheus.htm">inititive his father was all into</a>... yea.. its true<br/><br/><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56248-2003Feb11.html">wow</a> what a relevation.. and I got my <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/usatonline/20030211/4854954s.htm">emergency plan</a> at target.
