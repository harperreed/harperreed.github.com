Besides <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=679&u=/usatoday/20020318/cm_usatoday/3948029">ineffectual teachers, and boring classes</a> the United states commoner is threatened with a large scale war that may destroy us all. I was walking along the street this weeked and a bike messanger throw what amounted to a handfull of flyers in our direction. they said: "<b>G.W. Bush wants war</b>." Which seems to be not very far from the truth.<br/><br/>

In the past couple days I have noticed quite the mess of our foriegn policy. Maybe it was seeing president bush upclose and personal.. or maybe it was seeing the article that said that warrented nuke use would be in a confliect with china over taiwan and foreign policy. and then I see some articles showing how the U.S. is pissing china off beacuse we are not treating taiwan as a part of china, but as its own entity. The world is suddenly in a very unstable place.
