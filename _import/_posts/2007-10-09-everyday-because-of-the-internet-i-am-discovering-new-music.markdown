Legally of course.

But everyday I am discovering new music and listening to interesting artists. The internet is awesome. I can't really imagine what it would be like without it. I mean, I am able to think to myself "I would like to learn about classical music" and find a place that is offering an entire concert public domain.

it is great to see various modern artists like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Reznor#Nine_Inch_Nails">Trent Reznor</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead">Radiohead</a> abandoning Record labels and their past worlds and welcoming the new musical overlords.

Btw, I would like to learn about classical music. I am looking for something dark and brooding. Any ideas?
