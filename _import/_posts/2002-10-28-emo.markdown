excerpt: I juggled at six flags again this weekend. My hands turn so so black it is unnatural. they just change to a different shade altogether.. no matter how much you wash them. so troublesome. Anyway.. yesterday I worked a bunch and played with my mind not understanding time changes.. so funny. I am still pretty bummed about wellstone. That was a true loss (versus all those other people who died :P).

I juggled at six flags again this weekend. My hands turn so so black it is unnatural. they just change to a different shade altogether.. no matter how much you wash them. so troublesome. Anyway.. yesterday I worked a bunch and played with my mind not understanding time changes.. so funny. I am still pretty bummed about wellstone. That was a true loss (versus all those other people who died :P).<br/><br/>Here are some links.. <br/>
<a href="http://www.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=34754">A saddlecreek write up</a><br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Cinema/3117/sociosmurf2.htm">Socio-political themes in The Smurfs</a><br/><a href="http://www.emogame.com/">the Emo Game</a><br/><br/>Those are weird eh.<br/>Some weird things are going on in our world. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/russia/article/0,2763,820935,00.html">Russia</a> apparently decided not to wait for the "terrorists" to settle things and went ahead and gassed the church where 600 hostages were. The gas apparently killed around 150 of the hostages and has hopitalized 400 more. but fear not, the families of the dead will receive around $6000 for the trouble of losing a loved one. Oh and the U.S. is <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/bw-wh/2002/oct/28/102802615.html">not saying a thing</a>.<br/>I guess that more <a href="http://www.montserratreporter.org/pics/Hilary%20Clinton%20Senator.jpg">mainstream politicians</a> are starting to see the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=617800&TICK=NEWS&STORY=/www/story/10-27-2002/0001828664&EDATE=Oct+27,+2002">light</a>... However are they going to be helpful.. or are they just going to be annoying and use it to their own advantage? <br/>Gore Vidal is really mad. He is trying to start an investigation into <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,819931,00.html">whether the bush administration deliberatly ignored warnings</a> on 9/11. Now that would be insane.<br/>here is a joke for yall, however it isn't funny: <br/>
<blockquote><small>
President Bush and Colin Powell are sitting in a bar. A guy walks in and asks the bartender, "Isn't that Bush and Powell sitting over there?"<br/>

The barman says, "Yep, that's them."<br/>
So the guy walks over and says, "Wow, this is a real honor. What are you guys doing in here?"<br/>

Bush says, "We're planning WW III ".<br/>
And the guy says, "Really? What's going to happen?"<br/>
Bush says, "Well, we're going to kill 140 million Arabs this time and one blonde with big tits.<br/>

The guy exclaimed, "A blonde with big tits? Why kill a blonde with big tits?<br/>

Bush turns to Powell, punches Powell on the shoulder, and says, "See, smart ass?! I told you no one would worry about the 140 million Arabs.
</small></blockquote>
See.. this is the problem... <br/>i manically misspell weird.
