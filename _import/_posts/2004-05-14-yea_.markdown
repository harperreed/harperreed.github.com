kfc is a bad idea<br/>this statement can now be made for both the U.S. and india. I should have known ;) <br/><br/>tonight. suresh and myself are going out on the town, it should be fun. I need to find a nice place to eat. apparently we are going to go to a cool club later. that shoudl be nice. I am not sure what I am going to be doing this weekend. I am also not sure where I am going to be putting all the crap I have purchased. like that monkey and the elephant I got in delhi. stupid large things. <br/><br/>oh and all my friends here are looking at my india pictures too. but they are also delving into the depths of nata2.info and I am worried. they are gunna witness things that only seasoned viewers should witness. eep. haha. stupid public internet.
