<a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/030410/80/dxgkw.html">whoa</a>. I hope nothing like that ever happens to me. that would not be as fun. I would be said. especially if we were juggling and I caught a knife with my eye or something. we would probably have to stop the performance. <br/><br/>I am sad.. iron maiden is touring in europe. I only hope that they swing by chicago.. :( hopefully.. my dream would come true.. finally. In other news.. my dream of spring coming is also being fulfilled. not as quickly though.. but it is getting warmer.. however, my dream of me not being tired at work is not coming true and it doesn't look like it will anytime soon. maybe I should goto bed before 3... naw.. that would be insane and stupid.. obviously..
