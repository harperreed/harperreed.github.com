I have a strange hobby where I look at people peronal home pages. I really enjoy reading peoples blogs and learning all sorts of interesting things about them. heh. it is a strange voyeuristic hobby I guess, however it passes the time. I used to look primarily at slashdot comments. But lately I have been playing on <a href="http://www.makeoutclub.com">moc</a>, I recently <a href="http://www.makeoutclub.com/03/search_results.phtml?gender=either&amp;searchfield=location&amp;searchterm=greeley&amp;reverse=#">searched for people</a> in my home town of <a href="http://www.greeleycvb.com/aboutgreeleyf.html">greeley</a> and I found an interesting phenomona: if you search <a href="http://www.makeoutclub.com/03/search_results.phtml?gender=girls&amp;searchfield=location&amp;searchterm=chicago&amp;page=2&amp;reverse=#">chicago</a> you don't come across many women that are really big into the web cam/subtle porn culture,  whereas if you do the same search for <a href="http://www.makeoutclub.com/03/search_results.phtml?gender=girls&amp;searchfield=location&amp;searchterm=greeley&amp;reverse=#">greeley</a> 2/3 of the people are webcam girls. It is crazy. Check out <a href="http://5ilver.net">Mindy's page</a> and then <a href="http://caerrie.com/">Caerrie's page</a>. See what I mean. Wierd.. heh. someday I will be a web cam girl. and have good designskills and all that. In the meantime I will play <a href="http://www.gamespyarcade.com/software/webgames/sicktwisted//fivefinger/fivefinger_index.htm">this</a> game to pass the time. <br/>I somehow hurt my finger. I went and juggled a bunch this weekend and then when I woke up tuesday morning, my finger was swollen for no apparent reason. I refuse to awknowledge that juggling may have somewhat of a relationship to the swoll in my hand.
