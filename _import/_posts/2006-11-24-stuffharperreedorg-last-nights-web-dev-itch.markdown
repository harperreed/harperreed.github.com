<p>So last night after watching movies with my parents and making capes with my mom, I decided to redo my code repository/misc directory site that was at <a href="http://nata2.info/">nata2.info</a>. I decided that I needed to make my code repository a bit more "official" - so I moved everything that was at <a href="http://nata2.info/">nata2.info</a> over to <a href="http://stuff.harperreed.org">stuff.harperreed.org</a>. Then&nbsp;I rewrote the blorp script that was powering the repository using PHP and smarty. I used the <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/Text_Highlighter/">Pear TEXT/Highlighter</a> class to colorize the source code. It is pretty awesome. </p> <p>I like having my code and what not under the harperreed.org domain. It allows me to "own" it a bit more. It isn't just some random domain and it helps me feel more legit about publishing code. I made sure that the ease of publishing was still there and I hope to publish a lot more code now. </p> <p>Ahh. I like doing things like this. fast and dirty. hah. </p>
