I am watching wonder boys right now. it is so good. three movies I really enjoy are <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368925/">pirates of the caribbeans</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185014/">wonder boys</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190590/">o brother, where art thou</a>. those movies are so good. I love them. heh. I LOVE johnny depp. heh. so good. I wish I could act like him forever. but alas.. I can't. today I went to the <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1071177108-t610(1).jpg">dentist</a> and I later went shopping with my mom. I was able to find a <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1071199841-t610%281%29.jpg">blue screen of death</a> shopping terminal. hehe. it ruled. <br/><br/>the computer I am using keeps beeping randomly. it is really weird.<br/><br/>my father is doing well. which is really nice. it is so good to hear him talk and to be able to hang out with him. it will be great to see him come home. <br/><br/>i have been doing work. I am tired of work. I want to play/sleep/get better.
