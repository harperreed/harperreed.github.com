in fact I really didn't do much. I honestly barely made it to work. but on;y because I was so tired from working last night. I don't know what the deal was.. I was dieing. I drank soo much pop and candy  - I think I surpassed the point of it being helpfuland it became a method of sedation. stupid sedation. I am sitll in love however with wireless internet. so before any asks.. yea I like it. <br/><br/>to all those I sent that really lame email to. it was fun and I have never done one. so I felt compelled to experiment. isn't this the time to experiment with things that can affect your life adversely? when you are a teenager? I thought so. <br/><br/>whew. I am wearing my bling to make up for my unshaven appearance. it is weird. I don't thin ki am fooling very many people. ;)<br/><br/>tonight I think I am going to help my friend <a href="http://heroshomework.com/default.html">elisa</a> with some stuff and then hopefully clean my apartment. I ned to do this before hiromi gets home. I think she will die if she sees it in the state it is in. we are dirty dirty boys. I accidently posted a <a href="http://grouphug.us/confessions/488219660">confession to grouphug</a> - just kidding. I didn't. but that site is incredible. I donated money to them and so shoudl you. <br/><br/>learn about how the <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/health/ny-hscov0127,0,442476.story?coll=ny-health-headlines">shuttle broke</a>. learn why you shoudl vote <a href="http://www.blackstarsblog.com/bushin41point2.htm">democratic in 2004</a>. Our <a href="http://learntoyoyo.com">yoyo site</a> is roxor. <br/><br/>oh and my server is gettign POUNDED by this damned new virus that is out. I am not a fan. I am a fan of the shins - however. and caring is totally creepy. but somehow I broke my <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fmms2blog">MMS2blog</a> thing. sad day. I don't know why. it just stopped working. and started losing emails. everything seems to be configured the same. so I have no clue what is goign on. weird.
