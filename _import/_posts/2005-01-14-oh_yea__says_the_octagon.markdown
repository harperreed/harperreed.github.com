<br/><br/>there is a HUGE juggling convention this weekend. but I am sadly going to have to stay home nad work. it sucks. stupid work. always getting in the way. I am going to punch it. right in the head. PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH. 
<br/><br/>i picked up a surprise. I have been looking for a computer to manage my contacts, my business and everything. so I was going to buy a shuttle and just tuck it in the corner. but then I was like. WHY! oh WHY! would I get a pc when I hate them. hahah. so instead I picked up a <A href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">mac mini</a>. it has quicken. has bluetooth. and has wifi. so I can place it in the corner. and it will suck my phone's soul. manage my finances and basically just play well with others. I am pretty happy about it. <br/><br/>i will also be happy when my project is over. 
<br/><br/>love.
