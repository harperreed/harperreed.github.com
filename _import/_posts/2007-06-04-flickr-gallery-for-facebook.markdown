<p>So I decided to jump in and write a facebook application. It was really fun and pretty easy. For those of you who haven't been following this, <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> released <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/get_started.php">development kit</a> for their site that allows third parties to develop applications that reside inside of facebook's website. It is pretty nifty. </p> <p>So I used the framework I currently write software with. A mix of smarty and a solid DB abstraction layer, and modified it to work with facebook. It was relay fun and easy. </p> <p>Check out <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2481527745">my application</a> here and <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/flickrs/">go ahead and add it</a>. It is a really simple gallery that encapsulates some Flickr functions inside of facebook. it also allows you to publish your recently updated pictures to your profile. I will be modifying it to allow you to publish a random set of pictures, or to publish a specific set. </p> <p>It was really easy and I can see how powerful this will be in the future. I think I will be spending some time in the near future writing a threadless app. Stay tuned.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:62a4fbc6-ca79-41ff-a80e-9c685cbb3d9e" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]facebook, f8, threadless, flickr, coding[/tags]</div>
