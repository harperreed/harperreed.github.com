so we have been workign to launch this search engine for a couple weeks now - and I think we got it. congrats everyone involved. hehe. <br/><br/>i have been playing a lot. tonight I made a juke box for some <a href="http://www.killhannah.com">friends</a>, I hooked up <a href="http://www.ituners.com">my new website</a>, and I slept from <a href="http://www.bitboost.com/PS_67-72-207-6-10.gif">6-10</a>. it ruled. oh and I worked. hehe. a lot going on. <br/><br/>check out my <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/210720042330/Nokia6600(140).jpg">bruised</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/210720042330/Nokia6600(139).jpg">elbow</a>. it is <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/210720042330/Nokia6600(143).jpg">madness</a>. hands down one of the biggest bruises I have ever had. I also hurt my thumb - which is a bit more concerning. cuz I want it to be happier. but noooo. has to be sad. I hope they all heal appropriately. 
<br/><br/>tomorrow is a big night. I am going to prince, then going to crobar and hanging out with chris. then on friday - felix is spinning so we are all hanging out again. it is gunna be rather fun. <br/><br/>the other day I saw <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/210720042332/Nokia6600(131).jpg">these kids playing craps</a> on the train. I wanted to play - but I had no dollars. and I didn't know how. <br/><br/>the <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/210720042332/Nokia6600(124).jpg">spaceship</a> that landed in millenium park is <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/210720042332/Nokia6600(123).jpg">pretty crazy</a>. as is the <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/210720042332/Nokia6600(125).jpg">giant face</a> that blinks.<br/><br/>anyway. check out my new site: <a href="http://www.ituners.com">ituners.com</a> - a community site targeted toward itunes developers and hackers. it is pretty fancy. I think we will be launching our new application pretty soon. I am excited for it. I want to see peoples reactions. it will be nice I think. ;) whee. hopefully I won't get into trouble though. heh.
