<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/321424782/"><img height="180" alt="My pen island sample pen!" src="http://static.flickr.com/138/321424782_35382797e5_m.jpg" width="240" align="right"></a>So I got my <a href="http://penisland.net">pen island</a> pens last night. I am very happy with their samples. If I were going to buy a large order of pens for passing out, I would get them from pen island. They rule. Really a solid pen. I like the grip. </p> <p>Just to make sure that the samples were good enough I sent them to my brother <a href="http://dylanreed.org">Dylan</a>&nbsp;and my Dad&nbsp;to test out.&nbsp;Since&nbsp;I sent it to Dylan's house, his wife, <a href="http://photodork.org">Sarah</a>&nbsp;was lucky enough to actually receive the shipment and sent this email to Dylan:</p> <blockquote> <p>You got some weird package in the mail today from pen island.&nbsp; It didn’t strike me as sketchy until I read the web address, which eliminates the space between the two words.&nbsp; I saw that and thought, that’s very different.&nbsp; But holding the package up to the light, it LOOKS like there are two pens enclosed.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; Any chance Harper is sending you more weird stuff?</p></blockquote> <p>&nbsp;So I guess the jig is up. Be sure and check out <a href="http://penisland.net">penisland.net</a> to get your sample pens. They are only 4 dollars and are great pens. </p> <p>If you want to see&nbsp;some of the "more weird stuff" that I apparently send Dylan, <a href="http://dopeman.org/dylanhoody/">check out this hoody</a>. </p>
