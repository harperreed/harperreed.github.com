so a couple days a go I really screwed up my <a href="/photolog.php">photolog</a>. it sucked - because I didn't know that I had screwed it up until I lost a bunch of picture that morgan took when I was insane. now they are gone forever. how sad. but anyway.. <a href="/photolog.php">it is now fixed</a>. I figured it out - basically when I was cleaning out nata2.info I inadvertently changed the permissions on the dir that the photolog puts the photos in. sad day. so I fixed it back. thanks to the guys in #qmail for helping me. ;) <br/><br/>today there was a power outage and my server left for about 25 minutes. it was sad. cuz I was helpless. I hate that feeling. <br/><br/>i am going to go home now and take a nap. then possibly goto this android thing. hah. how fun. I hope I don't stay out tooo late. I need sleep.
