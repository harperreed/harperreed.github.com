so I couldn't sleep again. I ended up finishng the book I started - which is always a good feeling. I ended up starting a second book.. but I put it away with fear that if I didn't I woudl finish it too and it would be 8 in the morning. I suppose this is one of those days where I coudl afford to not sleep. but it would really wear on me. I don't want that much. so I solved the problem by getting up and making myself some dinner ;) I guess it is almost three but whatever. hiromi was up so I tricked her into making her some food too. I made some <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1073290732-t610%282%29.jpg">awesome dinty moore stew with peppered green beans</a> and hiromi made some <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1073290836-t610%282%29.jpg">peas with fancy sauce and seaweed</a>. mine was better. hahaha. so hearty. ;) <br/><br/>well I supposed I should goto bed. I don't really feel like it. but I can feel my energy level dropping as my body realizes it has food. ahhh.. food...
