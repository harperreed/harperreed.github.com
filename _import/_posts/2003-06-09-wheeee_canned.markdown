Today is sunday. I hung out a bunch. it was great. on friday. well.. I guess I should start from the beginning.. it was wednesday  and my mother and aunt had arrived.. we hung out and went to a steak place. it ruled. y little cousin was fun. on thursday I went to navy pier with them and we rented a 5 person bike. we ran about on the lake front and totally ruled the big city bikers.. we then went to chinatown and ate at joy yee's. it was great. lots of good food. then on friday we went to the aquarium. my little cousin was quite sleepy and was not into the dolphins. on saturday we rented a horse and ran about the gold coast. it was great. I hung out with matiss and beck and hiromi and marcia a lot. it was great. whee.. <br/>i need to do work. I forgot saturday night.. but whatever..
