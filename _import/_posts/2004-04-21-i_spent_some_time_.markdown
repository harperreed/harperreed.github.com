today has been pretty good so far. last night was fun. I went to <a href="http://www.nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1082531012-Vid%2804%29.3gp">juggling club</a>. yoyoed a bunch and then went to see <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1082523305-Nokia6600(442).jpg">the stare</a> play at  the mutiny. god I hate the mutiny. but the stare was awesome. so funny. I had never seen matt play guitar before - so it was an educational experience. heh. <br/><br/>i got hiromi a <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1082476656-Nokia6600(418).jpg">domo-kun</a>. she likes it a lot.<br/><br/>i am starting to make preparations for my trip to india. it is kinda weird. I have to be <a href="http://www.nmff.org/travelmedicine/index.asp">vaccinated</a> and all that. and I gotta get my visas. it is all so strange. I am getting pretty excited however. <br/><br/>all my work clothes are the same colors. almost. different shades of greys it is funny. monday and tuesday I wore the exact same clothes - just different colors. one day black pants/grey shirt - the next day grey pants/black shirt. both the same. <br/><br/>i somehow screwed up my phone. heh. it just sits here accepting text messages. billions of them. well only about 15. but still. I probably only sent 3. <br/><br/>it is sorta weird out right now. I can't tell if I am paranoid or not. or if I am just dealing with things weird. I hate it either way. but whatever. I will just have to see how things go. <br/><br/>i like brand nubian a lot.
