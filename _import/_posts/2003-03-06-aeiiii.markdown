So for the past week or so I kept seeing <a href="http://i.cnn.net/cnn/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/south/03/06/bin.laden.alive/story.ksmohammed.ap.jpg">this guy</a> in newspapers, on websites and on tv and I thought <a href="http://www.ronjeremy-themovie.com/">ron jeremy</a> had gotten arrested. I guess I never actually <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/south/03/06/bin.laden.alive/index.html">paid attention</a>.. when I finally did..  boy was I disappointed.<br/><br/>I recently got the new <a href="http://www.cursivearmy.com">cursive</a> album. It has a couple allusions to <a href="http://nata2.info/humor/bush/GeorgieW.swf">pinocchio</a>. weird. eh. that flash thing is cool though. Anyway.. the new cursive album is quite good. I enjoy it. I think it is weird that I buy a lot of cds. I mean I should/could jsut download everything from the intraweb or whatever. I guess I just feel better owning the actually cd. oh.. I relaly like the song "the gentleman caller." Have I mentioned that <a href="http://saddlecreekrecords.com/">saddle creek</a> rules. I also picked up a <a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~pjohnson/bright/bright.html">bright eyes</a> disc. I don't know what I think - however it is certainly growing on me. oh. the ipod is still one of the coolest things in the world. I don't understand how someone could not have one. especially if they like music. the fact that I have 400 or so cds with me most of the time rules. I have been listening to so much music now. it is quite something... so nice. <br/><br/><a href="http://nata2.info/humor/pictures/laulaja.jpg">whoa</a>. this weekend is a big juggling festival. I am excited.
