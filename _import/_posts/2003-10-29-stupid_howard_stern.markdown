So today.. I was watching cky4 hanging out with mark and matt.. waiting to goto juggling club.. and as soon as we should have left for juggling club.. I got a call from <a href="http://derek.broox.com">derek</a> exclaiming that my server wasn't responding. so I immediately called my lovely <a href="">colo facility</a> and mentioned to them that I needed my server rebooted. so they rebooted it.. and it came back up.. the women I was talking to mentioned that I was receiving an insane amount of traffic on port 80 from a huge number of ips.. so she told me an ip - which I looked up in my access logs and noticed that the particular ip was downloading the <a href="http://nata2.info/war/AC-130U_gunship_video_high.mpg">160mb war video</a> on <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=">nata2.info</a>. so I looked at the log file and noticed that it was 80mb in 5 days. and that almost ALL the requests were for the <a href="http://nata2.info/war/AC-130U_gunship_video_high.mpg">160mb video</a>.. and that they all came from this <a href="http://www.hk94.com/weblog/index.php?p=62&c=1">specific website</a>. which linked to my file. which also.. apparently was mentioned on <a href="http://www.howardstern.com/">howard stern</a>. so a link to my website.. for a 160mb file was mentioned on a nationally syndicated talk show. wtf. so I made a clever file to <a href="http://nata2.info/war/AC-130U_gunship_video_hi.mpg">combat the bandwidth stealers</a>.. .. that will slow the bandwidth right now.. but we shall see how it goes.. hehe..
