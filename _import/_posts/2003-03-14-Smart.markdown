The situation with that girl that was abducted in salt lake city is poised to become very very strange. I mean she was gone for quite a long time. anything can happen in that ime - <a href="http://drudgereport.com/smart.htm">including befriending ones abductors</a>.. thus patty hearst.. I guess it is probably psychological. but it still makes for a insane story. <br/>I think that the US should look at mormans as insane after this. The young girl was married to her abductor in a <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/884413.asp">crazy billigimist marriage</a>. She is 15. wtf. But the weird thing is - she was able to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/admin/article/largerphoto?contentId=A23106-2003Mar13&amp;thisnode=nation/states/ut">leave numerous times and didn't</a>. <br/><br/>i really want to travel. I wish that companies in the US were more into travel and vacation - I would love to take a month or two off and goto asia before it is nuked  -- but I don't want to quit my job. so what are my choices. quit. see it is dumb. I mean I haven't really mentioned anything to anyone.. so they may be into it. but I just thought of this tonight.. so it really isn't a plan or whatever. <br/><br/>yall should check out <a href="http://www.friendster.com/index.jsp">friendster</a>. it is pretty cool. slow as the dickens.. but a neat idea. kind of a sophisticated makeoutclub. and hopefully not run by skins ;)
