Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I'm a friend of Harper's, and he was telling me about your diving job. We began to wonder a couple of things about diving.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if you had to fight a monkey underwater, assuming that the monkey was a well trained diver (he's a natural in the water and very athletic), and the monkey was equipped with a knife and the necessary skills to use it, who would win this battle?  Also, if you needed a weapon to even the playing field, could you use a really sharp fireman's axe?<Br>
<br/>
Also, have you ever been attacked at a depth of 300 feet or more by a polar bear, and if so, what did you do to survive?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Scott<Br>
