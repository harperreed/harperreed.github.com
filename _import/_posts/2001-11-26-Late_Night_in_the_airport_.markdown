title: Late Night in the airport.
excerpt: So I was walking in DIA heading to my terminal when I noticed a set of "net terminals." I laughed and thought "how nice, free internet. Now there is a business model that will work." I think it was called go2net... althought io don't really remember. All I know is that they used linux and a slow version of netscape 4 and the terminal next to mine kernal panic...

So I was walking in DIA heading to my terminal when I noticed a set of "net terminals." I laughed and thought "how nice, free internet. Now there is a business model that will work." I think it was called <a href="http://www.go2net.com">go2net</a>... althought io don't really remember. All I know is that they used linux and a slow version of netscape 4 and the terminal next to mine kernal panic'd.. hehe..

So anyway, I got to my plane, sat down in my seat and we taxied around the tarmack and then we got all iced up and then we got de-iced then iced and then de-iced and then the crew suddenly worked more than 16 hours and needed a break - so we headed back to a terminal. We deplaned and then replaned at 12:30. now this flight was supposed to leave denver at 7:30, we did not take off until 12:50-1:00. I didn't arrive in chicago until 4:45 and then I had to wait for baggage until 5:00. I took a cab home and didn't get in and ready for bed until after 6:00. Then I got up for work at 8:30. it has been a long day. I only got 2.5 hours of sleep off of a 22.5 hour day. whoops. <br/><br/> on a lighter note, I am going to see britney in a few days...
