Man.. i don't know whats going on. I had the wierdest dreams recently. both of them involved the "weather." In one i was walking from cedar rapids to Mt. Vernon, and i was following a tornado. So everything was destroyed... then when i got to cornell, the tornado had somehow turned all of the "jocks" into vampires... it was really funny. it wasn't just jocks persay, but that is all i remember as now. we searched far and wide for pool cues to kill vampires with.. to no avail.. also a bunch of women whom i have never seen went to cornell and were excellent vampire killers. i think its wierd that in all vampire tales.. the protaginist is the only one who fully understands that the vampires are vampires.. <br>the other dream was different.. and i am not gonig to talk about it here.
