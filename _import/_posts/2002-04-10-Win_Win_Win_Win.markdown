I got an email today from <a href="http://www.aec.at">Ars Electronica</a> notifying me that
my website <a href="http://www.audreyhacking.com">AudreyHacking.com</a> has been accepted for entry in the 
<a href="http://prixars.aec.at/2002/">Prix Ars Electronica 2002 competition</a>. Whee. I hope I win. That would rule. In other news. I slept a lot last night. it was nice. however.. I slept so much that I overslept this morning. argh.<br/><br/>I think that I am going to purchase an ibook on friday. I hope anyway. that would really excite me. I want to see my friends to make sure that I want one. it just seems so cool. heh. I don't know about the whole mac deal. but whatever. I will really miss two mouse buttons.. hah. but I suppose I can deal with it. 
<br/><br/>i think I am going to make this weblog start embedding links automagically. so when I would type ibook it would look up ibook in a DB and automatically associate ibook with the apple ibook site. hmm.. maybe too much work.. especially when I have other thigns to do that are a lot cooler and get me money. haha. <br/>check out <a href="http://dylanreed.org/archives/00000011.htm">this</a> crazy entry...
