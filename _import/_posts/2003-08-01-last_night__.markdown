so last night when I went out with bernie, his friend phil and hiromi.. we fire my laser pointer to the top of the john hancock antennae. It was crazy. It totally was visible. Totally. I am a valley girl apparently. I can?t wait for it to get dark. I love the dark. Dark like a wolf.<br/><br/>Laser pointer stats:<blockquote><small>
Standard Red laser pointer: 650nm wavelength; <5mW; range up to 1,500 ft (457.2 m) in darkness 
<br/>
My Green laser pointer: 532 nm wavelength; <5mW; range up to 9,000 ft (2600 m) in darkness
