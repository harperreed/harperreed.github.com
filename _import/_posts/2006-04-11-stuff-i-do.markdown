<strong>Hacking Stuff </strong>

I quite enjoy manipulating and hacking stuff. It could a web application, learning AJAX or XSLT or taking apart the latest awesome consumer appliance. Ever since before college I have been interested in writing software, taking stuff apart and making new things.
<div style="text-align: center"><!--adsense--></div>
Here is a short history since 2001 of stuff that I have been concertrating on hacking or manipulating.
<ul>
	<li><strong>2006</strong> ~ We shall see...</li>
	<li><strong>2005</strong> ~ <strong>Play Station Portable</strong> - Having seen the jakes PSPs while working on squidoo, i was impressed with what they were able to do with them. So i went and bought a couple: One that was version 2.0 and one from a friend that was versino 1.5. I was able to test the new exploits and version changers on the version 2.0 one; while still being able to use home brew and other awesome stuff on the 1.5.</li>
	<li><strong>2004 </strong>~ Can't remember. I think it was clubbing or something a bit more temporal.</li>
	<li><strong>2003 </strong>~ <strong>Direct TV Tivo</strong> - Having purchased a Direct Tv Tivo i needed to expand it and get ssh and such so i could "use" the tivo as much as i could. Really all i did was make it so we could Tivo every simpsons episode ever. I was able to get injecting and removal of media into and out of the TIvo - but it just wasn't very helpful for our household. Here is my <a href="http://demon.dopeman.org/directivo/index.php/Main_Page">directivo wiki</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>2004 </strong>~ <strong>Playstation 2 </strong>- I did a bunch of work to make my roommates free playstation work much better. We didn't pirate games cuz that was lame and we didn't care. Here is my <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2004/09/15/playstation-2-hacking-2/">blog post</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>2003 </strong>~ <strong>Direct TV</strong> - I was working with smart cards and investigated the direct tv smart card. It was interesting.</li>
	<li><strong>2002 </strong>~ <strong>Sprint Samsung A500</strong> - Using the formula I derived from the Audreyhacking.com success, i started another site called <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2002/09/09/a500hackingcom/">a500hacking.com</a> dealing with the first of the "3g" phones from sprint. The Samsung A500 was a really nice phone that was color and had good connectivity. We read all over the internet to find information on how to extend and use ALL of the features of the A500.</li>
	<li><strong>2001 </strong>~ <strong>3Com Audrey</strong> - I was involved with sowbug and the audrey hackers on a community I created called <a href="http://www.audreyhacking.com">audreyhacking.com</a>. It was a great success and we ended up breaking the Audrey wide open. In 2001 I received an Honorable mention from the Ars Prix Electronica board for <font size="-1">Net Vision. It was an awesome community and is still going on.</font></li>
	<li><strong>2000 </strong>~ <strong>Dreamcast</strong> - Using some of the great hacks from the homebrew dreamcast teams, I was able to play awesome games my senior year of college. We downloaded and tested hundreds of games, and strangely only played tony hawk, NFL Blitz and some roll playing game; only games we actually purchased. Hah.</li>
	<li><strong>1999 </strong>~ <strong>Lego Mindstorm</strong>s - When the lego mindstorms lego robotics set came out I was quite excited. I created some great robots - including a biped, a scanner and a bunch of small robots that used sonor. Legos are awesome.</li>
</ul>
