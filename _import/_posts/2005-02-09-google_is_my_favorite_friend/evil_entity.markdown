<a href="http://jgwebber.blogspot.com/2005/02/mapping-google.html">this</a> is an excellent write up on the incredible <a href="http://maps.google.com">google maps</a>. the most important thing he says is: 
<blockquote>
I also think it bears noting that Google is pulling out all the stops
to build rich web apps, no matter how weirdly they have to hack the
browser to make them go. And I strongly believe that this is a trend
that is here to stay -- XHTML Strict/CSS/etc be damned. At the end of
the day, what really matters to users is compelling apps that let them
get their work done quickly.
</blockquote>it seems to me that this is an incredibly
important distinction that people often miss. I remember when gmail
came out, everyone was horrendously pissed that it didn't work in
safari, opera or some other good but not compatible browser - but that
wasn't the point of gmail (the product WAS a beta - and they fixed it).
it seemed that the point was that the internet needed to move forward
and be accessible - but not limited. gmail achieved this. and now the
map application is also pushing the limits. anyway. I am happy that
google is participating in the push of the internet. lets make it
bigger than a browser war. BAM.<br /><br />

speaking of google. this <a href="http://dw.com.com/redir?destUrl=http%3A%2F%2F99zeros.blogspot.com%2F&siteId=3&oId=2100-1038-5552022&ontId=1023&lop=nl.ex">asshole</a>
got fired for blogging about google. however - it became apparent that
he wasn't just blogging about google internals (which he admits that
google was real real cool about) - but that he was bloggin about
sensative NDA breaking stuff. Bad Bad. dumbass. however he does say
somethign that is pretty interesting. he outlined what kind of company
he wants to work for. <blockquote>
<ul>
    <li> I want to work at a company that focuses on disruptive technologies.</li>
    <li> I want work to be fun.</li>
    <li> I want to work on stuff I thought was interesting.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
i found this to be quite inciteful. I want to work on disruptive
technologies. I think yeknominc.com is disruptive, but I don't think it
is the same thing. I will have to push my campany a bit harder ;).
<br /><br />it will be interesting to see how things play out in the next little while. work work work.
