i got my <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1083598281-Nokia6600(609).jpg">tickets to india today</a>. it is pretty funny how every little step makes it more and more real. I imagien I iwll be writing on the plane "i am in the air, it now seems real." haha. I leave in 5 days. I can barely believe that 3 weeks ago - I had no idea this was to be happening.  this is going to be a good summer. <br/><br/>here is a <a href="http://www.mmmbate.com/harper-fun-party.gif">prediction</a> from a friend. ;) heh. that same friend happened to <a href="http://mmmbate.com/sadface/">break himself</a> while reading and riding a bmx bike. and by reading I apparently mean "thinking about philosophy."
