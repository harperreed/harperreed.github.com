This last couple days have been insane. So obviously i was in nyc working. then i hung out and partied all night in manhatten with amjad. That ended with us eating tater tots at 4 in the morning. and INCREDIBLE idea. seriously. whoever invented that was smart. S M R T.  then the plane fiasco. 

now i am at work. making stuff happen. I am flying out tonight to san fran for some fun with the <a href="http://gravitymobile.com">gravitymobile</a> guys.  It is pride weekend - so it is going to be nuts. no idea what it is going to be like or what to expect. hopefully goodness. oh yea. and awesomeness. 

speaking of awesomeness - last night while attempting to regain control of my life matiss found this incredible band called "3 inches of blood."  they are like a hardcore version of king diamond/iron maiden. really awesome. i itunesd it and now i "own" it. it is incredible. 

i need a job. btw.
