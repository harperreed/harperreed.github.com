So <a href="http://sethgodin.com">seth godin's</a> newest project is starting to <a href="http://squidoo.com/blog/"> leak out to the world</a>.  It is quite exciting to see what we worked on all summer become something real and tactile. I was choosen as an intern around the beginning of the summer and worked with the crew for the summer doing architecture and infrastructure design for the project. 

It was a very nice time. I was able to interact with very smart people who really knew a lot about the internet and this whole web 2.0 nonsense. It was invigorating to gather and look at different web sites, people and resources that were shaking up the internet and think about how we can harness that power to make the internet a nicer and easier place. 

I am excited for squidoo. <a href="http://squidoo.com">check it out</a>.
