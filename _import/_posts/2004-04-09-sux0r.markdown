so my l33t skills didn't work out today. I totally screwed up my servers. well not really. I am not on my new servers yet. I had to leave my old server in colo - which costs me a lot more money, and I had to use the switch- so I wasn't able to return it. it sucks.

I need a hug/nap/back massage/punch/rc car race. <Br><Br>doh.
