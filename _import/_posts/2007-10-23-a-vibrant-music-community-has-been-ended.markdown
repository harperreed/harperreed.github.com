Pretty insane. <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/oinkcd-servers-raided-admin-arrested/">Oink has been raided and the owner has been arrested</a>.

Oink was a really neat tracker. It was apparently fast, clean and super easy. Apparently it was the biggest private bittorrent tracker. Around 180k users. That is a lot of dedicated users.

It taught a bunch of people I know about bittorrent. It was used by anyone from joe smoe to actual musicians. It was a huge music community.

It is a bummer that it is gone. But I imagine something better will pop up shortly. What a sad day for music.
