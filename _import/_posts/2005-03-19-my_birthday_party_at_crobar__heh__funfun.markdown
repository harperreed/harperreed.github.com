<p>After that we came home. I changed into my cowboy costume. I love cowboys. I love dressing like cowboys. nobody does it. so I do it. or something. but anyway. after that we went to dinner at <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A03%3A18_27th_birthday_crobar&amp;img=IMG_3370.jpg">de cerno with scott and beth</a>. then we scootered our way over to crobar. where unbeknownst to me - a whole birthday party was set up. I assumed it was just going to be friends. but they decorated the walls and everything. it ruled. I was
happy. and then they brought out a cake that my parents had provided. magically of course. it was nice. I was happy. a great party. and I was dressed like a cowboy. there are many many <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A03%3A18_27th_birthday_crobar">pictures here.</a></p><p>tonight i am apparently going to a b list celeb party. I will bring cards and attempt to get juggling gigs. ;) hahaha. I love to juggle. wait a sec. </p>
