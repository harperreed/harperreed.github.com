<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/1324619617/"><img height="180" alt="The madass" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1190/1324619617_4654421c12_m.jpg" width="240" align="right"></a>I don't know if it has something to do with the motorcycle gas that runs in my blood (a lot of my relatives are "bikers") or if it is my dream of looking and being like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max">madmax</a>. Whatever it is - I really like how the <a href="http://www.bikez.com/motorcycles/sachs_madass_50_2007.php">Sachs Madass</a> looks. Today at lunch we were walking down Broadway and saw one locked up. It looks insane. It seems to be the melding of a custom scooter, a moped and a homemade motorcycle. It would be an amazing way to get around town during Chicago summers. Too bad summer&nbsp;is ending so soon - I would be tempted to use some adsense monies to scoop one up (although hiromi would probably want one too - then we would be the baddest assed scooter gang who is also married and really awesome). </p> <p>If you are really bored, check out my buddy <a href="http://hollywoodholt.com/">hollywood holt's site</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=w_kIUSr7-is">especially his video about mopeds</a>. </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:4860b498-f712-4006-98db-7a375441751c" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]moped, sachs, madass, motorcycle[/tags]</div>
