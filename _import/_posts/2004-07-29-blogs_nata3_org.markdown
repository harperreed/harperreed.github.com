i fixed it. so you can all use it as your <a href="http://blogs.nata2.org">friends aggregator</a>. w00t. if anyone wants to be added let me know. if anyone wnats to be removed - too bad ;). but yea. but yea. <br/><br/>last night I purchased more "nice" clothes. I hate buying clothes that are not "<a href="http://images.google.com/images?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=so+cool">cool</a>" but sometimes you gotta. and hugo boss is expensive. but oh so nice. I can now be fancy. I really get nervous about ties. I am just soafraid of breaking my "<a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=breaking+my+look">look</a>." but I imagine it will be OK. <br/><br/>i relaly want to release my ituneswww server soon. I think it will be fun. hopefully this will garner my <a href="http://www.ituners.com">ituners.com</a> site a bit of attention. <br/><br/>i need a redesign ;)
