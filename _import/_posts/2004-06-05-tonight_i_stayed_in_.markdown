i worked. and then I went and got my hair trimmed. haha. I mean shorn. after that I came home and PASSED out. it ruled. slept until about 9 or 10. ordered some food. watched 'bend it like beckham' and then watched 'platonic sex.' both were quite good. 'bend it like beckham' was really funny - I really liked it. sorta dumb - but really nice. 'platonic sex' was quite good - incredibly weird. a very strange movie. and relaly sad. but it was good. it is about a japanese AV star - and her very very hard life. it was done sorta non linearly - so at times I was confused. but it was overall quite good. ok. now is time to sleep until late tomorrow. <br/><br/>w00t
