I was reading through a bunch of sites and I noticed some quite interesting movements in the "world." First off, the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/42521.html">incredible epiphany</a> that two thrids of the world thinks that the U.S. is brought the terror onto itself. Also, in a very scary move, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20011221-95780908.htm">China</a> has apparently been subtly supporting the al-Qaeda. Whoa.
