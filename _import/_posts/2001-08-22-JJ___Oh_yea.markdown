So the other day I was on TV. Well not really.. maybe.. I went to a Filming of the <a href="http://jennyjones.warnerbros.com/">Jenny Jones</a> show. It was a riot. i laughed very very hard. Kinnera somehow got tickets, and at first i didn't know what to think. But i was immediatly calmed when someguy yelled "slut" randomly in the beginning. I knew i was among friends. WHat a piece of work most of the people were. I did learn something though, i learned that the audience is what the show is all about. The people on stage are just there as excuses for the audience to act crazy and disgustingly.
