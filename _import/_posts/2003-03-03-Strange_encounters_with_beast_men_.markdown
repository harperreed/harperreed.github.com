So this weekend was incredible. It was also INSANE. seriously. on friday I hung out with a bunch of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fshows%2Fladytron_2003">friends</a> at the ladytron show. Which btw, was really great. ladytron did a remarkable job of representing their sound exactly how it is on the record. Dayum.. that concert was such a fashion show.. heh. so fun. my friend rachel came with.. which was cool.. I haven't seen her in such a long time. so that ruled. <br/>then came saturday and the absolute insanity that is the <a href="http://superstarsoflove.com/index8.html">super stars of love</a> and <a href="http://www.modsquare.com/laptronica">laptronica</a>. it was so nuts. check out pictures <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fshows%2Flaptronica_march_2003">here</a> or <a href="http://chris.fm/lap.html">here</a> (basically both have the same content).. but yea. it was insane.<br/><br/>so apparently north korea is attempting to <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?artid=39110877">start</a> a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30106-2003Mar2.html">thermal nuclear war</a>. I don't quote understand Kim Jong Il's logic within his rhetoric. wtf. "he saddam, I will be your human shield." insanity. so apparently the war will <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2003100298,00.html">start</a> as soon as next thursday. oh.. and surprise surprise.. <a href="http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/breaking_9.html">saddam is now</a> within range of US troops. is that because we are planning on invading so we have moved within range.. rather than saddam beefing up his forces? nobody knows.. heh. I know.
