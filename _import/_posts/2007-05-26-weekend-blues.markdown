I love weekends. They are great. I love not having the time off from work and being able to hang out with hiromi. But lately, because I have been so busy I have to use my weekend to do work. It blows. So today I am going to take off from work. and I am going to hack my <a href="http://chumby.com">chumby</a>. and figure out some python tricks. I am excited.  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:124202d3-2471-49e2-ba8f-1559537b8e63" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]hacking, chumby[/tags]</div>
