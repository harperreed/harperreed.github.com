i love the internet. Awhile back I posted <a href="http://111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111.com">60X1.com</a>, I finally took the time to finish it and much to my chagrin it led me to some amazing sites:<br/>
<li><a href="http://www.tinkin.com/">tinkin</a> - this is the guy who made 60X1.com he has a bunch of really great anti war stuff. it is so good. it makes me happy I want to give this site to everyone as a gift. I think that politics is often forgotten when it comes to internet art. it is refreshing. but it reminds me that <a href="http://www.tinkin.com/peacefront.html">we are all sinners</a> <a href="http://www.tinkin.com/taliban.html">in</a> this <b>terrorist v terrorist</b> fight.
<li><a href="http://www.hoogerbrugge.com/">hoogerbrugge</a> seems to be an incredible designer. I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.thethirdplace.com/">this</a> style. It is like other <a href="http://www.requiemforadream.com">sites</a>. I don't know if that guy is in hitek or whatever they are called. but he is incredible. especially his <a href="http://www.hoogerbrugge.com/ml.html">Modern Living</a> set. 
<li><a href="http://www.surfstation.lu/">Surfstation</a> - I haven't had a lot of time to check this out. but it seems to be what I need. 
<li><a href="http://www.alternet.org/">Alternet</a> - this is an alternative new source. it seems to fit rather well with what I feel. Check out <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=13554">this</a> article called "Bush Threatens Future of Peacekeeping."
<li><a herf="http://www.23dpi.com">23dpi</a> is more along the lines of the sites I do. But it is done with style. hah. whereas the sites I do are done with a crayon. 
Well. I am out of here.. here being work.. work being ok. java being dumb. metallica being humorous. do you think the internet will become like shadowrun. I hope so.
