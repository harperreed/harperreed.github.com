tonight was kinda fun. it is the third night in a stint of going out.. and drinking too much.. not really too much.. but more than I should on a school night. I imagine the weekend will be very nice to have happen. <br/><br/>right right.. <br/>anyway.. so tonight some friends and myself went to smartbar.. where moby was hanging out. it is funny to hang out with moby. I mean we didn't chill or anything but I sat at the same booth as moby did. which will be my claim to fame. heh. he is shorter than I expected and he is very very white. similar to myself ;).. oh and very bald. he has a tattoo of a cross on the back of his neck. which I was not aware of. people were takign pictures of him a lot. <br/>it was really funny.<br/><br/>
anyway.. the exciting part of the evening was the cab ride home. I met a guy named jamal.. who talked about his experiences in pakistan.. in the us and his experiences being a muslim in our strange and very white(moby) world.. it was great. I love talking to people about stuff that matters. well matters is an interesting concept.. but at least.. stuff that is interesting and isn't fashion. <br/><br.dumb dumb fashion
