I am listening the refused. I enjoy them quite a bit. I have a new project going. Well I have a couple. I have mentioned both of them on here before. The first is <a href="http://riottech.net">riottech</a>, my little concert listing. I rule. hehe. the second is the <a href="http://a500hacking.com</a>/<a href="http://3gscreensaver.com">3gscreensaver.com</a>. The phone sites are a lot more interesting.. but riottech is more fun. The phone site is a great experiement in <a href="http://www.3gscreensaver.com/community.php">community</a> digital rigths management. I am trying to create a site that allows the community to decide what is appropriate or not. the key in this situation is to not get sued <b>;)</b> - it isn't working that well <b>:(</b> - alas I will concede with all demands.. and I am attempting to attain BMI, ASCAP, etc etc. it is maddening. <br/><br/>HEy I put up a links section that are different websites of some of my friends and interesting people I have found on the internet.. check it now <b>!!!!</b>
