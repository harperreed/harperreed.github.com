I sit here in training for a search engine.. and the world potentially falls apart. well.. one thing is for sure.. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54422-2003Jan28.html">bush rules</a>. I mean jesus, can that guy be a worse president. I think many peopla <a href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/content/bog/nmbogert19.html">agree</a>... but the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/01/28/wirq28.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2003/01/28/ixnewstop.html">evidence</a> <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/story.jsp?story=373367">is</a> <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20030128-32833614.htm">convincing</a> ... but is it <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52135-2003Jan27.html">real</a>.. I don't think that matters honestly.. I don't really know anyone who wants to go to war with saddam. and the aggressive nature of the U.S. "front" is stirring up the world in the most unpleasent way. I guess we shall see what happens <a href="http://webcenter.newssearch.netscape.com/aolns_display.adp?key=200301281120000198813_aolns.src">tonight</a>.. a lot of people are <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/?u">waiting to see</a> .. or should I say hear ;) will <a href="http://www.marcmelzer.net/sotudg/">you</a> be listening... I know I won't. <br/><br/>i am tired and sick. soon I will be in bed. I hope.
