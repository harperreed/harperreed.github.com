<p>Today i picked up our wedding rings. So now we are officially married in other peoples eyes. hehe. Its pretty neat - but wearing a ring will take some getting use to. It is currently interfering with my typing - but I think that is my perception and not reality. I imagine I will soon get used to it and will forget that i ever thought it was weird. heh. </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:16b460bd-c486-4776-9a74-375ce146ffec" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]wedding, marriage[/tags]</div>
