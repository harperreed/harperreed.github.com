I really think its funny that I like metal. Sometimes its the greatest joke of all times. heh. I went to a rocking death metal show the other day. It was great. I got tickets for <a href="http://www.cannibalcorpse.net/">cannibal corpse</a> and <a href="http://www.imotorhead.com/">motorhead</a>/<a href="http://www.morbidangel.com/">morbid angel</a>. I am so excited. also - the dimmu borgir disc rules. RULES.<br/>Lately I have been laying in my room just hanging out. it is crazy. just chilling. it is so so nice. veru funny. well whatever. I had something exciting to say. but I lost it.
