So i was playing around with <a href="http://campfirenow.com">campfire </a>and i noticed that i could easy write a bot for it. so i did. it sucks. but it shows what you could do. how i love www mechanize. and perl. check it out:

Oh yea. <a href="http://campfirenow.com">campfire </a>is sweet. the <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals </a>guys did a great job. although i am a bit worried about how you can spoof the message post url in a tinurl and make anyone who clicks on it say whatever you want them to say ;)  but that is naturally a weakness in a webchat.. especially with ajax.

here is the speak url;

/room/44/speak?message=message+here

if someone goes to that while in room 44 they will say "message here"

heh.
