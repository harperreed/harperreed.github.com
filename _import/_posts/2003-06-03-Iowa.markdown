<br/><b>phunktoad (9:38:30 AM):</b> stop wasting my falafel
<br/><b>linuxKILLa (9:38:34 AM):</b> sorry
<br/><b>linuxKILLa (9:38:41 AM):</b> today I went to the store and got three drinks

Last night was really fun. I hung out with marcia again.. we just chilled. I forget how nice it is to chill out and not go out. I have gone out almost 20 nights/month for the past year. that is roughly 240 nights/year. heh. I think it might be about 65% of the nights.. whoa. I am a club kid. (this is where I would make the house/techno music noise.. um-tis um-tis um-tis.. and dance). anyhow.. <br/><br/>
