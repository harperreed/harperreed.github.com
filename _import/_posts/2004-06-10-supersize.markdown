last night hiromi and I went to go see the movie called <a href="http://www.supersizeme.com/">supersize me</a>. It was made by some guy named <a href="http://www.supersizeme.com/home.aspx?page=aboutdirector">Morgan</a> <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm1041597/">Spurlock</a>. he ate mcdonalds everyday for one month. it totally destroyed him. heh. he was broken. it scared me. are country is so broken. we are going down the drain. sad day. <br/><br/>rachel gave me <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1086842973-Nokia6600(889).jpg">a bike</a>. it rules. I am pretty happy with it. it seems to be a nice bike - other than the weird candy cane paint job. I think I am gunna paint it black and make the sides say dumb things. that will be cool. of course. haha. I need to tune it up. I can't decide what to do first. I shoudl probably paint it first and tune it up second. haha. umm. yea. I keep dreamign about popping wheelies and doing tricks. haha. I am lame. and by lame I mean incredible. <br/><br/>i broke down yesterday and purchased another copy of Anna Karenina. I gave up on attempting to find my old copy. mostly cuz I really want to just finish it. what this really means - is that matt and katie will bring me my copy tonight. haha. apparently oprah has <a href="'Anna Karenina' ">decided to promote</a> the translation I am reading. I really don't know how I feel about that. I guess it is good. but I feel like a dork carrying an oprah book around on the train, whereas before I felt like a badass. so yea. I guess I gotta finish it and move on to some light reading: gravity's rainbow. hehe. <br/><br/>RULE<br/><br/><a href="http://www.attackmorgan.com/gallery">here</a> are some pictures that morgan is posting
