I need to find a woman I want to marry, which will lead to a house & kids OR some horrible tragedy will strike & will be shaken into adulthood<br/><br/>

Very true.<br/><br/>Well. I am glad that no terrorist plot succeeded yesterday(that we know of), and it is unfortunant that a gunman shot people at LAX.

We could be in for some <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/05/iraq.usa.reut/index.html">trouble</a>. I think it is interesting that almost every country has called for the U.S. to NOT attak Iraq.. yet we still need to oust a axis of evil. I hate our politicians foreign policy right now. It is so annoying.
