For some reason my google talk is broken for my person gmail account. It doesn't log me in while i am in gmail, or gaim, or even using their gtalk client. Its really weird - because if i log in using another account - it works fine. But if i log in using my primary account. its broken. So annoying. Especially because people are starting to adopt google talk as a more de facto way of contacting peeps. and because i was just starting to hit up all my friends with gmail accounts. So sad..

I wonder why it happens. And whats weird is that it is account based. not service based. Like when my gmail stopped working for a couple days. So crazy.
