So i was walking down lake on my way to work and i passed this deli that makes pretty good sandwiches and i noticed the super metal IRON MAIDEN fonted sign. This place has a dude that works there and he is METAL! like totally hard, dressed in black, long hair and smokes cigarettes all day. he rules. and his influence is apprieciated. 

Anyway. being a metal head myself. i about died when i saw this sign ;) hahah. w00t.

i love metal dudes. so much wasted unappreciated talent. ;)

where's my jackson guitar..?
