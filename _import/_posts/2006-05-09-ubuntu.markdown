I have been using ubuntu for a minute here while i compile some software for use on my soekris box at work. I am attempting to move from the <a href="http://nycwireless.net/pebble/">old pebble linux</a> to the new <a href="http://pyramid.metrix.net/FrontPage">pyramid </a>linux made by the <a href="http://metrix.net/metrix/">metrix guys</a>. Its pretty dope so far. a lot more modern, but sadly not mature. I need to compile in PCMCIA support and whatnot. a real pain ;)

I did find a hint for one of my initial problems while building out the <a href="http://pyramid.metrix.net/FrontPage">pyramid</a> <a href="http://pyramid.metrix.net/BuildEnvironment">build environment</a>.

Since we don't have any linux boxes laying around, i have been doing most of my work in VMWARE. Which rules - especially because i can download the player and then a ubuntu image and have every thing be kosher. However, ubuntu is seemingly installed to be based off of a CD. so i kept getting this error about inserting a cdrom when i was attempting to do a apt-get install. it was annoying.
<blockquote>Media change: please insert the disc labeled
'Ubuntu 5.10 _Breezy Badger_ - Release i386 (20051012)'
in the drive '/cdrom/' and press enter</blockquote>
I ended up stumbling upon <a href="http://crschmidt.net/blog/categories/technology/planet-planet/">this guy</a> who had come across a similar issue and posted a really easy solution for it.

Basically you just comment or remove the line in your /etc/apt/sources.list. Then apt-get update and apt-get install your way to freedom.

I will post more later when i am successful or not. ;)
