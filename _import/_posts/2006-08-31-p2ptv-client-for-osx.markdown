Is there no p2p tv client for osx. You would think the chinese woudl be able to port something fancy like <a href="http://tvunetworks.com/">tvu</a> or <a href="http://cache.tvants.com/">tvants</a> or even <a href="http://www.pplive.com">pplive</a> to osx easily enough. It would certainly make my life easier. hah. well. if anyone knows of any - let me know. and democracy player isn't really what i am looking for. hah.  stupid hippies.

Meanwhile - hiromi and i had a nice day of just hanging out. We are going to see hustle and flow in a second. That should be fun.
