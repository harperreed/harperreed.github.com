today I installed <a href="http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html">my new router</a>, looked over my taxes, accidently watched a <a href="http://www.vidkraft.com/ffvp/2003/under_the_tuscan_sky.htm">really dumb movie</a> and discussed <a href="http://whiteprivilegeconference.com/">white privilege</a> with a <a href="http://www.eddiemoorejr.com">friend</a>. it was a good day. 

<br/><br/>check out these links: <a href="http://www.infofreako.com/jad/enpitsu-e.html">crazy pencil carvings</a> from japan. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0001IXT36/nata2productions/103-1905659-8966249">this movie</a> will be good. <a href="http://hinterlands.cc/index.php?showtopic=27">this bug</a> is really big. <b>;)</b>. <a href="http://www.davidgaddis.com/piercing.html">this comic</a> is pretty incredible.<br/><br/>read <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/acc/events/peggy1.htm">this article</a> - then think about it. <br/><br/>i am feeling good right now. which is really nice. I am excited for my birthday. I really don't know whats happening. but it will be fun I know. I think we are going to dinner tomorrow. and I think we are also going to go help chris remove stuff from his house. anyway.. I am now going to mas with morgan. I like mas. hah. I like morgan. weird. it should work out. wtf. I love when I start a blog entry and it devolves into something completely drival based. hahah. no direction or scope. similar to all the projects I work on at work.  BAM sucka.
