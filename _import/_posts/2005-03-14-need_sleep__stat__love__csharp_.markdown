<p>I am rather sleepy. tonight/today was good. I coded all day in anticipation of my new tool being released. I am excited. unfortunantly all my work is going to be looked at as sketchy - cuz the competitor released their &quot;upgrade&quot; which is significantly better than what they had, and rather similar to what I have done. doh! I guess I have to redo and make mine a lot better. ahh.. innovation. I am excited however.. it is a lot of fun. <br />
</p>
<p>I made this: <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fcode_drop&text=HTTPget.cs">HTTPget.cs</a></p><p>
Maybe you can use it in an app that crawls websites that require cookies - or spiders things. it is really fancy. I will update the header so it isn't SOOO ghetto in a bit. currently my priority is sleep. </p><p>stay tuned for the release of  <strong>CrockODolla Hunter</strong>. ahahahahja&nbsp;</p>
