haha. 
<br/><br/>so this weekend was pretty ridiculous. it was generally out of control. basically I just hung out and did the things that make my life incredible. haha. it all started on Wednesday (of course). <br/><br/> so for the past couple weeks I have been working  nights a lot. so I have also had a LOT of screwed up sleep - i.e. none. especially at night. soo... on Wednesday I was struggling with attempting to not stay up all night - so I hung out at home and though about sleeping. at around 12 I went over to this bar called elm street liquors and hung out with some friends who spin there. it was pretty dope - it isn't the coolest bar, but it is not so bad. we then went to vips and hung out at the strip club. haha. I have gone to a strip club more in the last month than I have ever wanted to. like 4 times. hah. and I keep going. it is weird. just a place to go I guess. so we closed vips. I got tacos and then played computer. I was kinda late for work that day (weird I know). <br/><br/>then on thrusday, my friend greg and I just hung out at <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A27_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1249.jpg">crobar</a>, the W and neo. it was real laid back - but once again  - out until 5. <br/><br/>and then friday - I hung out with my friend crystal. it was pretty fun. we just chilled around the city. got Italian ice in Lincoln park - watched hero. it was pretty good in the theatre. after that crystal went home and derek came. <br/><br/>this is were the weekend gets pretty retarded<br/><br/> so derek and got together and then met my friends at crobar. crobar was <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A27_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1253.jpg">pretty</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A27_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1263.jpg">nuts</a> and we got a lot of drink and I swear we barely made it home. heh. <br/><bR> then on saturday we met at crobar for the metallica show. we took an <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05500.jpg">escalade limo</a> (wtf). it was pretty awesome. there was <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05512.jpg">food and drinks</a>. and it was a pretty <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05532.jpg">good show</a>. one of the people who came with us brought her parents. her mom, mary, was really awesome. we gave her a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05540.jpg">lesson</a> in <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05542.jpg">rock</a>. she was <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05610.jpg">hardcore</a>. ;) as were <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05611.jpg">we</a>. after that we went to transit - were I danced a lot. and then went to <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05674.jpg">crobar</a> and hung out. a lot of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05657.jpg">fun</a>.
