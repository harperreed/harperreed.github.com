today, my girlfriend and I have decided to break up. It wasn't the best of situations for each other.... So after fourteen wonderful months together we are separating amicably. it was the only choice that allowed for us to maintain health and happiness. at least in our current situation. 
<br/><br/>
However.. now I am a little lost.. I don't know what to do or to say.. I type these words and fear a numbness that could quickly approach. How come love doesn't conquer all..
<br/><br/>
I type these words and I wish that things were quickly different. but whenever I wish that I know that to wish that is a bad thing. It is hard now. however I know it will be easier soon. I will sleep, get up, go to work, go home, eat, and repeat. I will go out with friends. I will hang out and meet new people. I will get back into a pattern. I just want something I cannot have right now. I need to realize also that I still have my friendship with her. that she is still my best friend. I haven't lost anything really. I mean.. really
