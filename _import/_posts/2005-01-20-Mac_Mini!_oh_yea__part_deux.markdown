so I got my mac mini. it <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F200120051137&img=Nokia7610%28038%29.jpg">came</a> during my last blog entry. I was excited. 
of course. apple had to <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F200120051002&img=Nokia7610%28040%29.jpg">pack it</a> all nice and such. I appreciate how minimal apples packaging is. although - it has become rather <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F200120051002&img=Nokia7610%28041%29.jpg">predictable</a>. but is that bad? predictable packaging. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F200120051002&img=Nokia7610%28043%29.jpg">it</a> is not very big. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F200120051002&img=Nokia7610%28044%29.jpg">i like the back</a>. and I dislike the gargantuan <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F200120051440&img=Nokia7610%28047%29.jpg">powe supply</a>. so dumb. ...<br/><br/>more pictures laters. 
<br/><br/>oh oh oh. and the suck of it all is that osX doesn't support my fancy pants nokia 7610. stupid apple. haha.
