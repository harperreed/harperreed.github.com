The office is real nice.  it is real real open and everything is pretty cool. i am so far happy here.

and i am tired. i relaly need a nap. and reading of a book. and hanging out. 

although i miss hiromi - it seems she is getting more acclimated to japan. it is nice to talk with her on aim though. i can't wait until a google talk client comes for mac. which reminds me. i need another monitor to put blood on.
