I just put <a href="http://www.opendns.com">openDNS</a> into place at <a href="http://www.skinnycorp.com">skinny</a>. It is a neat DNS "replacement" that is a bit more intelligent than regular DNS. it apparently checks for phishing and notifies the user that they are going to a "phishing site." This is pretty cool stuff - however i am worried about who chooses the phishing sites. I mean, what if they become a bit more vigilant and start blocking "<a href="http://nata2.info/?path=misc%2Ftextfiles">hacking sites</a>" or "<a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&img=screenshot_BLOCKED.jpg">sites deemed inappropriate?</a>" scary! i kinda wish it wasn't so effective as to completely blind the user to the phishing attempt. However - i totally see this being great for someone like my <a href="http://reedbooks.org">parents</a> or my apt. people who don't really want to worry about DNS or all that crap.

One of the other cool features of openDNS is that it has a nice domain level spell checking. so if you mispell <a href="http://nata2.org">nata2.org</a> as <a href="http://nata2.og">nata2.og</a> it will redirect you to nata2.org. haha. awesome.

even though it is really cool and potentially very very helpful for not as savvy internet users i am still a bit freaked out by the control that <a href="http://www.opendns.com">openDNS</a> has over what i view. I guess though that all DNS servers have that control -but that <a href="http://www.opendns.com">openDNS</a> is overt about its use of the DNS system for good.

Well. i will of course chronicle how it goes..
