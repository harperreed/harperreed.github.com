Sometimes bloggin just doesn't seem appealing. It seems like a something that is just pointless if you are not feeling the blogging vibe. So i have waited until i was in the blogging vibe. It had been an amazing couple of days. great things have happened. 

btw, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0104797/">Malcom X</a> is a great movie. I think the book is one of my favorite books in all of my life. it is so good. So amazing. His life is such an inspiration for really anything. It is amazing that some of that stuff happened in the city of which i live now. Quite something. 

So lets see.. probably a week ago was when i last really updated my blog. I was probably ranting about hifi equipment or some nonsense. well i need to order the parts and move on to my second version of my mini hifi set. I am pretty excited about it. i like the idea of ultra modular parts - like replacing my sonic impact with something better or something more complicated. It will rule. 

This morning i had an awesome dream. I dreamt i was an astronaut in training to go into space. something about either a contest or some lottery-esque way of achieving atronautness. anyway - i was an in astronaut training and it ruled. it was not a dream with much action. it was all about detail. i had to do so much crap to become an astronaut. i don't even think i actually went into space - i had to get up and goto work. stupid work - always fucking with me getting into space. stupid space. 

So.. last week. i was really poor. and i started keeping a lot better track of my money as of a couple weeks ago. so i have been keeping an eagle eye on every transaction. I started to notice that i have signed up fo a lot of shit and that the key to winning the internet is reoccurring billing. opt-out, reoccurring billing. don't ask just bill. that is the true nature of the internet - oh.. and voyeurism. that rules too. 

This weekend was crazy crazy busy. I had so many supercharged events that i was never relaxed or calm. On friday - i went out with <a href="http://danielleclock.org">danielle</a> and kira. We met up with the gaylords at the kill hannah loft and hung out for a bit. I was able to see brian, whom i haven't seen in a minute and that was awesome. then went to Y bar  and soundbar to see ritchie hawtin. it was pretty dope. i like really HARD techno. nothing better.  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/1248900/">Check my pictures.</a> they rule. it was halloween so their were some pretty crazy people out. 

The on saturday i got up - got my tux on and went to scott and beths wedding. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/1249110/">here are some pictures</a>. It was a beautiful wedding. a lot of fun. it was at the newberry library and it was pretty chill. No religion which rule. religion in weddings is LAME. i decided while standing in the wedding i decided that my wedding is going to be like this:
<blockquote>
<small>
<strong>official:</strong> do you<br />
<strong>couple:</strong> we do<br />
<strong>official:</strong> RECEPTION!<br />
</small>
</blockquote>

awesome. yes. I thought so. So the wedding ruled. and the reception was good. i had veggie food - which was OK. nothing thrilling - but a nice change from the super red meat i have had at ALL the rest of the weddings of my life. Scott and Beth were sooo happy. It ruled. All their family were so happy it was awesome. 

Later that night Amjad picked me up and we went to Y bar for a minute - where we saw the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/57707109/in/set-1251062/">BEST costume ever</a>. It was a WWI soldier in complete WWI get up. It was pretty crazy. So out of place in Y bar. after Y bar we went to crobar where it was hand down the craziest i have seen it. Somehow 1000 young women got a memo on saturday that saturday night was dress as provactively as possible night. It ruled. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/1251062/">the pictures are scadalous</a>. hehe. The best part was that the camera was almost a community item that night. Amjad took some, the gaylords took some and i took some. heh. yea yea. ;) 

Then on sunday i stayed in and made whotheheck.com with jeffrey. heh. i was supposed to goto redno5 and check out Major Tailor - but i missed out. i was upset. but not totally bummed. that site is fun. 

On monday, halloween, we had work. and then we all went to crobar for the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/1264716/">gaylords halloween party</a>. It ruled so much. I was a black metal rocker. I had a trident. and i looked awesome. heh. i was wearing my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/58454393/in/set-1264716/">CRAZY 6-8inch platforms with skulls and spikes</a> attached to them. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/58454952/in/set-1264716/">Olivia did my makeup</a> and matiss gave me some clothes. It turned out soooo damn good. i RULED. haha. a <a href="http://static.flickr.com/33/58461533_59aec0528e_s.jpg">black metal warrior</a> for sure. The most insane part of the night was that my costume was so so extensive that nobody recognized me. Claudia totally didn't recognize me and was totally surprised when i showed up. but then after dancing and rocking for a while my feet hurt and i was soooo tired. so i went home. my feet are still screwed up. soon they will feel better. i hope. 

The best was that on tuesday i went to bed around 6:00pm and suddenly woke up around 8am. wtf. hah. no break. it was like i blinked. that is insane. i didn't even mean to. i meant to take a nap. i even set my alarms for 8pm. but nope. slept until dawn. it felt so good. 

so that is pretty much up to now. 

i rule. and that is pretty much the bottom line. i need to finish some books and finish this movie. but that will all come later. 

oh yea. work is pretty dope. i enjoy it. 

Hiromi is coming for christmas. i think she is flying in on the 19th and then leaving on the 29th. i am excited to see her. i am going to have to figure out how this is all going to work. cuz we are having a party on the 23rd - which means we will have to fly out to colorado on the 24th. which is rough. but that is fine. no prob. heh. just a tired christmas eve. stupid jesus.
