I also want to make a friends section like nick whatever's blog - which I don't want to find right now. I need to rethink my design a bit. but I am happy so far. to load peoples rss I am thinking about using xmlhttp or something. it should rule. <br/><br/>i am also thinking about combining <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">tiddywiki</a> and xmlhttp to create a super fancy smooth javascript notepad for my site. it should rule.


<Br><br/>also check out my friend kevi's site: <A href="http://www.slimkevi.com/">slimkevi</a>. he is trying to lose a bunch of weight. the site is totally awesome. good luck. I hope he finds himself successful.
