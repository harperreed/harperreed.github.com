<p>This weekend was really fun. We went and saw the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8aKWiWbkCc">Police at Wrigley</a>. Had some good foods. Hung out with friends from New York and Tokyo. And generally drank more than we should have. Totally entertaining. I also hung out with my friend Atkins - who just moved to Chicago. exciting. Hope all your weekends were just as awesome. </p> <p>I have a couple more Pownce invites. I am not sure that i buy it as a great service, but if you want to check it out&nbsp;- tell me a joke in the comments and I will send you an invite if its a good joke. </p>
