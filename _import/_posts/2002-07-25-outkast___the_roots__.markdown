Last night, Kinnera, matiss and myself all went to the smoking grooves tour. It was ok. the tweeter center sux0rs. It has such bad acoustics. horrible. sounds like hell. I got better acoustics in my leg.  We saw the <a href="http://outkast.com/">outkast</a>, the <a href="http://www.theroots.com">roots</a>, <a href="http://www.lauryn-hill.com/">Lauryn Hill</a> and <a href="http://www.jurassic5.com/">Jurassic 5</a>. It was kind. <br/><br/>please take a minute and check out <a href="http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/war12.html">this</a>. It is one of my favorite comics. Also <a href="http://www.demian5.com/">this</a> is incredible. It is so fun and I love it. In other strange and real news.. Matiss and I watched the mothman prophecies the other night. it was weirdly scary. Not in a normal sense at all. just surprisingly scary every once and awhile. kinda strange. Matiss did some research and he found <a href="http://www.prairieghosts.com/moth.html">this</a> site. whee.. <a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20020725-100255-1720r">men in black</a>. <br/><br/>goddamn <a href="http://rense.com/general27/plstt.htm">cheney's america</a>.. I guess <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59423-2002Jul24.html">some people are looking out for us</a>..  but it appears that the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2148924.stm">gods are not paying attention</a>.. ugh.. that will not be a fun experience.. <br/><br/>oh.. and I forgot to mention.. we finally have completed the slot car purchases. our collection is complete. so I guess we will be having a slot car party soon enough. it should be fun. we need more cars though.
