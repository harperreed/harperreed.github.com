tonight.. I did and possibly finished my taxes. it is incredible. I thought this day would never come. It wasn't very hard. especailly with lovely turbotax helping me along the way ;). That is very funny to me. All I had to do was answer questionsa nd hope it came out right. I hope that I did it correctly. <br/><br/>I hated tonights academy awards.  I thought that beautiful mind should not have been awarded all of the awards.. especially since it left outsome rather important facts about the math guys life(nash). I was sad. <br/>I went out the otehr night to a fashion club. It was fun. A lot of beautiful people. hehe. a lot of silly looking people too. I hop ei was in the first group.. but probably not. alas..
