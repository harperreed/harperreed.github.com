<p>Last night, I started and finished Freakonomics. It was awesome and hilarious. I have been reading the <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/">freakonomics blog</a> for a year or so - and I decided I finally needed to read the book. I enjoy Stephen&nbsp;Levitt's discussion of things that I never thought about. I especially liked the chapters about Chicago gangs. <a href="http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/people/venkatesh.html">Sudhir Venkatesh</a> was amazing. I can't imagine what it was like to study and hang out with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster_Disciples">Gangster Disciples</a>. </p> <p>If you have not read Freakonomics, you should. I will lend it to you - but you really should buy it and lend it to your friends. </p> <p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>I forgot to mention how sad/conflicted/happy&nbsp;I was that the name "harper" was predicted as being popular in 2015. I will no longer be "special." heh.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:ea3eddd4-3b35-4d54-8285-a64a2e67f5c8" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]books, Freakonomics, economics, interesting[/tags]</div>
