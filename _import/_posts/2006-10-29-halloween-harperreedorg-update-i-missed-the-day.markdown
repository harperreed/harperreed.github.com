<p>Ahh Halloween. How I love the city during Halloween. It is absolutely madness. This Halloween was quite a bit of fun. Not as crazy as last year - but more fun. On Friday skinnycorp had a nice Halloween party that I was responsible for. We had mark the knife perform and some <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/281089524/in/set-72157594350220283/">really awesome costumes</a>. The only bummer part was that I didn't get dinner and ended up getting <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/281143395/in/set-72157594350220283/">rather drunk</a> toward the end of the night. It was awesome though. <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=aLliduShY6c">Jacob had knives thrown at his face</a> and we all laughed a lot. Except for Charlie; who found the bar much more entertaining than a world famous juggler. lame. </p> <p>On Saturday - I hung out at Claudia's new club: Debonair Social Club. It was neat to see it <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157594350204013/">under construction</a>. I helped with the LED lights and I hope to be able to help contribute some more. It is really cool to see it grow. Then after that I went and hung out with the Bindlestiff's and some other circus peeps. We went to a haunted house then to dinner. It was pretty awesome. </p> <p>After dinner I hooked up with Tag and James and we went to a horrible party. We kidnapped Kira and then went to Tuman's until 4. It was pretty awesome. I had a great time. </p> <p>I then slept late. and then redid harperreed.org. I didn't leave my house until it was dark. I accidentally didn't see the day. Whoops. </p> <p>Like I mentioned - I redid <a href="http://harperreed.org">harperreed.org</a>. I made it a bit more modern and styled after what I have been doing lately. It just aggregates all my other sites and web presence into a more central location. If you are looking for info on me - that is the place to go. <a href="http://harperreed.org">Check it out</a>.. and <a href="http://harperreed.org/contact">let me know what you think</a>. I wish I owned harperreed.com - stupid shipping insurers. </p>
