I just watched the korean movie <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0364569/">oldboy</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldboy">read this</a> if you want to ruin the movie). Jesus Christ that movie is insane. I was not ready for the endeavor of watching that movie. Quite something. I rather enjoyed it. I am a sucker for movies that have good soundtracks. The story blew my mind. I had no idea it was going to become what it became. Whew. I have owned it for a number of years and just finally got around to watching it. I am glad i did.
I just ordered the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo">The Count of Monte Cristo</a>" - so we shall see how it compares. Even though oldboy isn't a direct transposition of the story, i wonder about the plot of the story versus the movie. and what similarities their are.
Man. what a rough movie.
