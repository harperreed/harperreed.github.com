  so I was woken up to do more work.. and I am really annoyed - because the sysadmins decided to chaneg the password and not tell us. which means everything stops until they are awaken and tell me. however.. they turn off their phones and are not coming in until later. so I have no way of doing my job. this is annoying. stupid phones. why isn't the ringer embedded  in to peoples temples.
