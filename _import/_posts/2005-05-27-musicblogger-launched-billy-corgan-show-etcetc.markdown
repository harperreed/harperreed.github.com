So last night i went with scott to see Billy Corgan's new show. My friend brian is playing keyboards in it so it was nice to see. The stage is amazing and i like billy's new stuff.  it was weird cuz i haven't been to a concert in a very long time. so being at this one was like being at a concert in my living room. it didn't seem real. but it was i know. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F270520051105&img=Nokia7610%28194%29.jpg">i was there</a>. 

I also got impatient and launched <a href="http://musicblogger.org">musicblogger.org</a> last night. it is pretty solid. my first "real" ruby on rails app. hopefully we will get some more users and really hit it big. BIG i say. check it out. use it. whatever. 

i also updated the <a href="http://demon.dopeman.org/sexOffenders/">sexOffenders map</a>. ti should support most of the zip codes in illinois and has roughly 19k of sex offenders listed. it is still a pretty insane breach of privacy. i guess it is just cuz they are people who could be risk on society - but still. this view into their life is rather insane. we have got a bit of <a href="http://www.gapersblock.com/news/archives/2005/05/#008559">writeup</a>. hopefully more and more. 

i laugh when i think that all i so is create viralish websites. hah. nata2.info is off the hook. OFF THE HOOK.
