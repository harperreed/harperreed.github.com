I woke up and attempted my hardest to not make it to work. however, much to my chagrin, I now find myself at work. on the way in - I listened to midnight oil's diesel and dust. I have been listening to music from my past lately. it is pretty fun. yesterday I purchased a bunch of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?artistId=26435">crosby and nash</a> and then a bunch of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?artistId=147370">neil young</a>. both are so so good. <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=614915">neil</a> <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=614991">young</a> is quite something. the song "<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=614915&selectedItemId=614889">The Needle and the Damage Done</a>" is sad. hah. <br/><br/>i am attempting to import all my super old 2k blog entries. I found them on archive.org. so that may be done later tonight. we shall see. they are pretty funny. <br/><br/>check out <a href="http://www.proxientunit.com/">mikes blog</a>.<br/><br/>i think I need to take a day off or something. I really need to want to come back to work. I think havign this past weekend be so full of events(especially ones that I felt some sort of accountability for) I didn't get a good chance to sleep in and just screw around. so my body/mind didn't have a good amount of time to just screw around and relax. I need to sit in a decompression chamber and let everything leave my mind/body and wonder around - coming back when it wants to. I think that woudl help with my boredom/strangeness as of late. haha. but then.. I don't think I am really strange.. just not really settled. heh. <br/><br/>last night - matt and I walked to the liquor store and got beers and drank them on the way(we walked) to the movie theater to see eurotrip(it was bad). it was a really fun time. movies are expensive however. it doesn't really make sense how expensive they got. it cost me 15 dollars to get in and get a small amount of food. I coudl have purchased a domain name.. and hung out and made a webapp to make fun of <a href="http://derek.broox.com">derek</a> for that much money. <br/><br/>i really want to see osama and the passion soon.
