Check out <a href="http://emf.myvirtualmodel.com/emf/EMFServlet?state=pickup&id=3EDA7BE61.7039535237830568E2041054505958&lang=en&z=0&retailerid=0&retailerid=0">me</a>.. build one for <a href="http://www.mvm.com">yourself</a>... <br/><br/>I found some chicago based <a href="http://www.coudal.com">design</a> kids. It is neat to see the internet that I know and love suddenly appear in a physical form around me...  For design-geek events check out <a href="http://www.anonfed.com/">Anonymous Federated</a>. It seems to be cool.. but has no events posted at this moment. <a href="http://www.75orless.com/">Here</a> is a good indie rock music review site... that is ran by <a href="http://www.slatch.com/">this</a> guy maybe.. I guess the test is whether it will hold up to <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/">pitch fork</a>.
