I have been waking up earlier lately. it is rather strange. I am still a bit late to work(9:10/15), but I am up longer and feel better. weird. maybe it is cuz I don't go out EVERY NIGHT. heh. umm.. yea.. well I have been workign a lot on this ringtone stuff.. it is fun. but I have to plan a lot to make sure it is robust. stupid robustness. I hate you so much ;). Today I ordered a <a href="http://shure.com/earphones/eseries_e2c.asp">pair of new headphones</a>. I don't know why. I don't really need them. maybe cuz I am a gadget guy. they are getting great reviews.. I really wanted the <a href="http://shure.com/earphones/eseries_e5c.asp">better ones</a>. but I figured I should probably buy headphones that are cheaper then the ipod. heh. a good rule of <a href="http://www.preschoolprintables.com/small%20girl%20&%20thumb.gif">thumb</a>. <br/><br/>speaking of music. I am going to make a metal mix cd for some friends. if you want one email me your address and I will send one your way. I hope it is good. but yea. it will be sludgy newish stuff.. like isis, pelican, fudge tunnel and the like. apparently I need to check out earth. but yea. it will be a dark and very heavy mix. <br/><br/>i love finding stuff.. and I really love found <a href="http://www.foundmagazine.com/">picture web sites</a>. it is so interesting to see what people lose. <br/><br/>it is important to be aware of what is happening around you. especially when bush is our leader. check <a href="http://www.democrats.org/scotus/bushenstein.html">this out</a></a> - so scary.. yet so true. I love our president. <br/><br/>When I was little and I thought of growing up.. I dreamt of being like <a href="http://joi.ito.com">this guy</a>. he wrote for <a href="http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/supergeek/story/0,24330,1856,00.html">mondo 2000</a>(<a href="http://www.deoxy.org/t_mondo2.htm">this interview</a> changed my worldview).. is international.. is really smart.. and is in the right place at the right time. he is a dj.. so he knows music.. and I am stalking him.. wait no.. I mean.. I just read his <a href="http://joi.ito.com/static/aboutjoi.html">about page</a>.<br/><br/>anyway.. my life is confusing. I am thinking about attempting to leave the country within the next 5 years.. just for the experience of living somewhere else. I think it would be a good step. I don't want to be a cubicle monkey for the rest of my life. <br/><br/>everything looks spelled wrong.
