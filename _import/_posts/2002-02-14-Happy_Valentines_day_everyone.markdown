title: Happy Valentines day everyone
excerpt: "Today, I was almost hit by a car. I mean real close. It wasn't my fault either. I was just walking in the cross walk and this taxi tried to hit me. I didn't flinch at all. Which in retrospect I think is quite wierd. the car just slammed on its brakes and I kept walking and didn't think anything wierd was going on. heh. whatever.Today is such a wierd day. "

Today, I was almost hit by a car. I mean real close. It wasn't my fault either. I was just walking in the cross walk and this taxi tried to hit me. I didn't flinch at all. Which in retrospect I think is quite wierd. the car just slammed on its brakes and I kept walking and didn't think anything wierd was going on. heh. whatever.<br/><br/>Today is such a wierd day. <a href="http://cmdrtaco.net/">Rob Malda</a>, of <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">slashdot</a> fame <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/14/143254&mode=nested&tid=166&threshold=3">proposed</a> to his girlfriend(or announced the proposal). It is fun to <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=27966&cid=3006988">read</a>. heh.. ahhh nerds.. how nice.. and romantic.. heh.. <br/><br/>
Well.. it is valentines day. Which is somewhat sad in light of not having a girlfriend. but it is nice.. because I feel that things are still special between us. I am so happy and thankful that we are still friends and that we are still very close. It was an incredible 14 months. and I don't plan to let it end at that :).
