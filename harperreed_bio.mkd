My name is [Harper](http://nata2.org/). I am an engineer excited about real time, social software and the open source software movement. In a previous life, I was the CTO of the awesome Threadless. I am patiently waiting for the singularity.

When I am not working or causing problems you can find me blogging about random stuff, yoyoing, juggling, hacking random internet appliances or going out and having a good time in Chicago.

Be sure and check out my blog. If you are interested my resume is located here and you can contact me here.

Be sure and take a gander at my photos.
