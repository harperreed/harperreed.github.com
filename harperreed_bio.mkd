My name is [Harper](http://nata2.org/). I am an engineer excited about real time apps, social software and open source software. In a previous life, I was the CTO of the awesome [Threadless](http://threadless.com). I am patiently waiting for the singularity.

When I am not working or causing problems you can find me [blogging about random stuff](http://nata2.org), yoyoing, juggling, hacking random internet appliances or going out and having a good time in Chicago.

Be sure and check out my [blog](http://nata2.org). Here is my [resume](http://harperreed.org/resume). 

I am very easy to get a hold of - [feel free to reach out](http://harperreed.org/contact). Send me an email at [harper@nata2.org](mailto:harper@nata2.org) or hit me up at [@harper](http://twitter.com/harper) on twitter.
