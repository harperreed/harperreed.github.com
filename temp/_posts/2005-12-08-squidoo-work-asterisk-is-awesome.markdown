So asterisk is amazing. i have been plating with it quite a bit. I recently hooked it up at skinnyCorp and got it to be there PBX. it is quite amusing to have that much control and granularity with the phone system. I am contemplating rolling out a small scale service based on the asterisk platform. It should be interesting. stay tuned. TUNED I SAY.

Work has been awesome.
