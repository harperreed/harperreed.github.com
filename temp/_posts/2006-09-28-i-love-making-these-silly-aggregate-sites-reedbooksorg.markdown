I started with <a href="http://thestoryofharper.com">thestoryofharper.com</a> and then I created the site for <a href="http://hiromiandharper.com">hiromi and myself</a>. So after writing all the cool classes to make this easy I decided to make the <a href="http://blogs.nata2.org">blogs.nata2.org</a> site and then tonight I redid the reedbooks.org site to be an aggregate of my families blogs. fun fun.

The sites follow a pretty simple formula. Basically all i am doing is picking up the RSS feeds of a particular set of blogs and displaying them nicely. I am also grabbing some flickr pictures to spice up the pages.  And thus creating a place where a person can view all of the set of peoples stuff. I guess this would be considered a mashup of sorts.. but it feels more like another view of the blog.
So <a href="http://www.reedbooks.org">reedbooks.org</a> - I originally got <a href="http://www.reedbooks.org">reedbooks.org</a> as a domain for my mom's email. So since i had the domain and it had an unused wordpress install on it - I decided to change it back to the blog aggregate that it once was. So I just copied the form of <a href="http://www.hiromiandharper.com">hiromiandharper.com</a> and did some other trickery. It is cool. So <a href="http://www.reedbooks.org">check it out</a>. Now I just got to make sure everyone keeps updating their blogs.
I wonder what will be next.... hopefully doing the same thing but making money. I do love money.
