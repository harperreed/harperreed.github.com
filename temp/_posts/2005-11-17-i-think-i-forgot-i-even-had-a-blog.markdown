Work has been really crazy. We are having a <a href="http://www.threadless.com">sale</a> and its nutso. are servers were totally owned by our users and we had to fight every one of them to survive. but we did it. and now threadless is ruling - more or less. soon it will be ruling always. and forever. 

flickr is so slow sometimes.

i am sleepy.  i will be going to bed soon. i really want to install linux on my old desktop to be a fileserver and an awesome computer - hosting things like a phone system and the like - but i don't have a monitor. heh. i need to find something. 

ok. gnight.
