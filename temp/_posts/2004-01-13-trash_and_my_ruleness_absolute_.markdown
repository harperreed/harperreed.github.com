So I have been trashing my blog by quoting aim and such. it is nice and humorous but it totally throughs of the blog feel and makes it kinda childish. I really don't like it. but I am still laughignabout this prank I pulled on my friend scott  - so I will share it with yall.. it is the last one for awhile.. (unless I continue to be awesome)<br/><bR>So the setup was that I wanted to play a joke on scott. I was posting random stuff to friendster and I came up with the idea of posting scotts cell phone number to friendster as a "dial a song." so I did it. here is my post:<blockquote><small>
check out all the new chicago music by calling<br/>
chicagos new dial-a-song. call:<br/>
8xx-xxxxx-x0<br/>
it rules...<br/>
</small></blockquote>
I posted it and waited a long time. it sucked. I hate waiting. I thin I could never go to war... cuz the waiting would bother me.. not the killing.. ;) I eventually broke down and told broox about it: <blockquote><small>

<b>Derek R Brooks (2:08:26 PM):</b> hahaha<br/>
<b>Derek R Brooks (2:08:38 PM):</b> i'm calling it<bR>
<b>linUXkilla (2:08:38 PM):</b> funney eh ;-)<bR>
<b>linUXkilla (2:08:40 PM):</b> haha<bR>
<b>linUXkilla (2:08:42 PM):</b> don't tell<bR>
<b>Derek R Brooks (2:10:03 PM):</b> I called it<bR>
<b>linUXkilla (2:10:13 PM):</b> what happened<bR>
<b>Derek R Brooks (2:10:18 PM):</b> voicemail<bR>
<b>Derek R Brooks (2:10:30 PM):</b> I asked if there was anything new in the chicago music scene<bR>

</small></blockquote>
and then about 5 minutes later I got this from scott:<blockquote><small>
<b>phunktoad (2:15:02 PM):</b> what the<br/>
<b>phunktoad (2:15:08 PM):</b> I just got a call on my cell phone<br/>
<b>linUXkilla (2:15:24 PM):</b> ?<br/>
<b>phunktoad (2:15:26 PM):</b> "hey... I was just calling to see whats up with the chicago music scene, seeing if there's any new artists out there"<br/>
<b>phunktoad (2:06:30 PM):</b> "alright, bye"<br/>
<b>linUXkilla (2:06:56 PM):</b> wtf<br/>
<b>phunktoad (2:07:01 PM):</b> right<br/>
</small></blockquote>
and then finally he found out:
<blockquote><small>
<b>phunktoad (3:17:56 PM):</b> harper<br/>
<b>phunktoad (3:17:58 PM):</b> I hate you so much<br/>
<b>linUXkilla (3:17:59 PM):</b> yea<br/>
<b>linUXkilla (3:18:00 PM):</b> hahaha<br/>
<b>phunktoad (3:18:18 PM):</b> god damnit<br/>
<b>linUXkilla (3:18:38 PM):</b> I rule<br/>
<b>phunktoad (3:18:58 PM):</b> I should have read that whole message<br/>
<b>linUXkilla (3:19:32 PM):</b> I removed the post<br/>
<b>phunktoad (3:22:23 PM):</b> ass<br/>
<b>phunktoad (3:22:25 PM):</b> I was like <br/>
<b>phunktoad (3:22:34 PM):</b> what the fuck, why are all these people calling me<br/>
<b>linUXkilla (3:22:59 PM):</b> did lots of people call?<br/>
<b>phunktoad (3:26:15 PM):</b> at least 6<br/>
<b>linUXkilla (3:28:44 PM):</b> nice<br/>
