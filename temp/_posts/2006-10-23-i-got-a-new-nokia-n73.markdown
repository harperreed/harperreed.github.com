<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/277051287/"><img height="180" alt="N70 and N73" src="http://static.flickr.com/109/277051287_a4bb938093_m.jpg" width="240" align="right"></a> So I sold my <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4142101">Nokia E61</a> to my friend Scott - he will probably use it more than I and he doesn't mind it not having a camera - and I used the money to pick up a Nokia N73. </p> <p>The <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nseries/index.html?loc=inside,main_n73">Nokia N73</a> is a really nifty phone. It is a bit longer than my <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nseries/index.html?loc=inside,main_n70">Nokia N70</a>, but noticeably thinner and quite a bit lighter.&nbsp; Like the N70 it feels really solid. It isn't as heavy feeling. The N70 always seemed heavy. I don't know why. I ended up getting the plum and silver one. It is pretty good looking. Obviously the next generation in the N7X series. </p> <p>The OS is pretty much the same as the E61. It is running Symbian 3rd edition - so I get all the cool apps and what not that were available for the&nbsp; E61. I am really excited for the podcasting app. I want to download all the <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/">tedTalks</a> to my phone and listen to them on the bus. One nice thing is that the screen is much higher resolution - so the everything looks a lot better. </p> <p>The main reason I got the N73 was because of the awesome camera. It has an actual mechanical shutter and an autofocus lens. W00t. The only lame thing is&nbsp;it still&nbsp;has the ghetto LED flash still - but this one seems to be a bit brighter and a bit faster.&nbsp; <a href="http://shozu.com">Shozu</a> works pretty well. I am not really happy about the new photo app. I prefer the old one. I feel it was faster - although it isn't as pretty.&nbsp; And the fact that I now HAVE to orient the pictures a certain way. So annoying.. </p> <p>I am excited to see how the pictures turn out. So far they look pretty good - but yea know. its still a mobile phone. </p> <p>So I went to the store with Tag. He picked up a E61 to act as his work phone. It was kinda funny because he ended up getting one that was branded.&nbsp; Some Hong Kong wireless company - three? anyway. so he was all pissed because they gave him a bunk phone. So I told him how I upgraded the firmware using a bundle of hacked Nokia tools. and how it was not hard but kinda scary. So he went home and did it. Now he has a fresh E61 with no issues. Awesome.</p>
