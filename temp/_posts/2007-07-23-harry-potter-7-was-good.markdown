<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the new Harry Potter. I just finished it. barely 24 hours after I bought it from borders(I had originally ordered it from amazon, but it was delayed by skinnyCorp being closed). I was a reading machine.</p> <p>It was a good ending. Enough complexity to make things interesting. It was good. If you like harry potter - do not hesitate to read the book. </p> <p>Ok. Now I need to check my email and what not. And more importantly hang out with Hiromi - who I has been very patient with my constant engagement of a silly children's book.</p> <p>heh.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:3f656a9b-7bc1-48d2-873a-9f4d63e5bc16" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]books, harry potter, done[/tags]</div>
