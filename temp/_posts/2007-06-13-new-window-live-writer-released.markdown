<p>I love Windows Live Writer. It makes blogging really easy. I don't have to worry about spelling, forming my links or the technical aspects of creating an entry. All I have to do is type in this app. and BAM. it works wonders. </p> <p>Anyway, they released a new version of Windows Live Writer. It has all sorts of neat new features (real time spell checking!!) and is pretty snappy. Check out&nbsp; the release at the <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live writer page</a>.
