so this mornign at 7 we started launching a site at work. I was sleeping. because last night was halloween. and I didn't goto bed early. stupid satan.. always keeping me up. <br/><br/>nothing is better than death metal at seven in the morning.<br/>Last night, after my work.. I hung out with hiromi and read. it was fun. then we went to reza's - which is always good. after that we cabbed it up to winnies thing at park west. which was full of hot women with fake boobs.. we decided it wasn't for us and we went to the "where ravers goto die party" - which was a lot of fun. but strangely around 12 it became not fun. so we went to the texas space. it ruled. no I am waiting for mark to pick me up to take me to a juggling festival. whee..
