You should go, and while you are there, you should come check out <a href="http://morefishthanman.com">Scottv</a> and my talk on technology agnosticism. It should be delightful. For those of you that know me - the time slot is hilarious: 9:30 in the morning. Wth. I rarely have an interesting happening that early in the morning. I am usually sleeping.

<a href="http://techcocktail.com/home/tech-cocktail-conference/">Here is some generic info</a>. <a href="http://techcocktail.com/home/tech-cocktail-conference/speakers/#HARPERREED">This is my bio</a>. We are finalizing our presentation (i.e. writing it) and are attempting to figure out how to beat our <a href="http://docs.google.com/Presentation?id=dd3wvxq5_43gq3g4x">last presentations</a>. I will post slides later. I promise.

<strong>UPDATE: </strong><a href="http://docs.google.com/Presentation?id=df4n6gb3_98j4bs2mfk">here are the slides from our presentation</a>. It seemed to go pretty well. It was really fun to participate and speak. I have also placed <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nata2">all my presentations on slideshare</a>.
