I think it is interesting that i can make a purchase and then use the restroom in a restaurant - but i wasn't allowed to before i made the purchase. Like going to starbucks and buying a coffee so i can use the bathroom. the 3 dollars means i could use drugs, kill children or whatever they are trying to stop by making the bathrooms for customers only. 

I see this sort of transaction a lot. Making a purchase to gain privilege. I do think it is ripe to be exploited. i just wonder how. and i wonder how many people do it subtly without meaning too.
