so apparently I need to stop going out so late. cuz this morning I was punished. heh. so tired I was. Yesterday was generall a bad day. nothing really worked out well. I was able to go get dinner with <a href="http://www.markhayward.net">mark</a> and his brother. that was a lot of fun. it was a bit hot out. so I was sweating like a pistol. anyway.. I then went home and inadvertently fell asleep on my lawn chair. that was incredible. I had lawn chair marks all over my face. hehe. a grid of sorts. my project at work is on its final legs.. so we are almost done. I love how I screw up colloquialisms. <br/><br/>more and more people are recognizing me around town from friendster. weird.
