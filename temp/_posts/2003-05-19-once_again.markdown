i feel like I have been ehre before. it is almost four o clock.. although the post will not have that time stamp.. the server's time is a bit off.. silly rebooting.. silly non syncing time.. silly lazy sysadmin.. but anyway... we went and saw the matrix tonight. it was fun. I have decided that I will probably finsih my tattoos soon. I am scared though. cuz I know they will hurt and I hate that part about that. but I hate the fact that they are not quite perfect yet. I feel as though I am about to get sick. I hope it isn't the case. I hope the case is a case full of strawberries and magic. that is what I woudl like right now.. and a bunch of sleep. ahhh... sleeep..
