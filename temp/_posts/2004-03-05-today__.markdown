so my accupunture last night was cool. it strangely seemed to effect my mood - which I was not quite ready for. I was totally a irrational, tired and emotional mess. haha. but I knew it while it was happening - so I just acted weird a couple times and was mostly quiet. I wonder if it was the actual accupunture that put me into a funk or if it was just the fact that I was tired and the pushing myself to be <a href="http://www.ronlim.com/betterstrongerfaster1.gif">stronger , faster, and better</a>. hah. nobody know. however I do feel pretty good this morning. my arms hur tough... ha. <br/><br/>so my friend jon comes today. it should be fun. I am always a bit apprehensive  when friends come to visit for a long time - cuz I don't know what to do for entertainment. I figure however. that we will have a fine time just hanging out and such. I am pretty excited. <br/><br/>oh. oh. oh. check out this <a href="http://www.evilzug.com/stuff/goatse/tribute/">goatse tribute page</a>. a really nice presentation <b>;)</b>. if you ever wondered where that <a href="http://nata2.info/humor/flash/pingu.swf">crazy pinguin game</a> came from - <a href="http://penguin.omnihosts.net/">here is a pingu history page</a>. and then  finally <a href="http://bakla.net/">this</a> page is almost worth mirroring to insure it never leaves. hah.
