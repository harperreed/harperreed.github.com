So everything worked out and Hiromi and I were married on tuesday. It was really fun. and really barely more than signing a paper. which i liked quite a bit. Today we did the first part of the visa stuff. It was insane. and really crazy. totally stressful. government offices are annoying and really bureaucratic. i felt like i was in a <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000416/">terry gilliam</a> movie. hah. But we are almost done - and the next part doesn't seem to be too much different than this part - just a bit more "official."

Well i am off. I will of course update everyone with all that happened in a little bit. but in the meantime - chekc out the <a href="http://nata2.org/photos/album/tokyo-summer-visit/">pictures</a>.
