so this day has been weird already and it is barely 9:30. first last night I got home from juggling club and was notified that my paypal account was terminated due to 3gscreensaver having porn on it. I actually don't know if that was the reason they just sent me a terse email with <a href="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/use/index_frame-outside&ed=mature">this</a> link. so I am assuming - unless they think <a href="http://www.savechrisfromprison.com">save chris</a> or <a href="http://www.weownthesun.com">we own the sun</a> is "mature" - it has to be <a href="http://www.3gscreensaver.com">3gscreensaver</a>. what is screwed up is that it is a user contributed system, so I didn't put the porn there. so I was tricked. but also it is messed up cuz the site was almost 2 years old. haha. so they have ignored it for two years. awesome. so now I am pretty much SOL for a lot of my commerce stuff. it sucks quite a bit. I guess I have to open a new paypal account and hope they don't cancel it. but my other paypal account had a rating of almost 600 - and had been open since the days of X.com. sad. anyway. I hate them. I may have lost the $150 that was in the account as well. it is sad. I will porbably try calling but I doesn't seem like it is any use. <br/><br/>on a much happier note I played a MEAN game of tetris today on the train. I started at level 9 and made it to level 15. I beat my personal high score of 100,000. rule. especially since it was in the 25 minute train ride I have. I didn't screw up once. I gotta play more. more more more. <br/><br/>i solved all my programming problems today in the shower. it ruled. hopefully it will work. nobody knows ;) <br/><br/>tonight is skinny puppy. I am pretty excited. <br/><br/>so I was chilling - reading my blog reader and I see the headline "<a href="http://www.edithfrost.com/index.php/weblog/harpers_so_funny/">Harper's so funny</a>" over at <a href="http://www.edithfrost.com/">edith's</a> page. hehe. I was like. woah. I win. haha. she was linking to <a href="http://www.dopeman.org/dylanhoody/">dylans hoody page</a>.  which I would like to point out is incomplete - cuz my punk little brother isn't cooperating and taking the much lauded action shots. someday. SOMEDAY. I tell you. <br/><br/>ok I am going to listen to death metal and do work.
