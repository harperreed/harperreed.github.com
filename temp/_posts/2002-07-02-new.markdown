  for news goto:
  Rense.com - kinda sketchy but interesting and fun filled. also a tad bit anti-israel/semitic(kind sketchy).
  Drudge Report - a very simple and effective website. Sometimes it is nonsense.. or stupid poli-fashion shit. but its usually worth the visit.

for news goto:
<li><a href="http://rense.com/">Rense.com</a> - kinda sketchy but interesting and fun filled. also a tad bit anti-israel/semitic(kind sketchy).
<li><a href="http://drudgereport.com">Drudge Report</a> - a very simple and effective website. Sometimes it is nonsense.. or stupid poli-fashion shit. but its usually worth the visit. 
<li><a href="http://ratm.com/new2/news/current_events/index.html">RATM current event page</a> - this is a pretty good collection of links, that is seemingly updated daily. It is sanctioned by RATM which is funny.
<li><a href="http://www.indymedia.org">Indymedia</a> - a democratic media outlet. sometimes good.. sometimes dumb
<li><a href="http://www.cnn.com">cnn</a> - heh. 

<br/><br/>so those are the links that make up my every morning. check em out.
