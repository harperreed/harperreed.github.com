so my party was fun. I had a good time. it was great fun to see everyone. I was disappointed that some people didn't get a chance to show up. but whatever. I now know who my real friends are. haha. umm jk. or am I ;) we had a huge number of people turn out and we ended up drinking all my beers and wines. it was quite nice. <a href="http://johnwhitney.net">john</a> from <a href="http://www.worldbook.com">work</a> stopped by.. which was a good surprise. I like it when your <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~mgorman/spring.gif">social worlds</a> collide. when different groups come together and meet. the party started about 9 when some people arrived we just kinda hung out until aroudn 10:30 when it started to get a little busy. then around 12 it was <a href="http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2001/jul/06bhisa.jpg">hectic</a> and I was a bit too drunk to have an incredible time. so I took a nap. haha. until 1. then I hung out with marcia and such until 2:30 -3. I went to bed around 3 - 3:30. it was fun. hiromi's date seemed to be cool. he better be really cool however. or we will have to bring the noise. hehe. we are her "older" younger brothers. <br/><br/>umm then today I basically just slept and screwed around. it was nice. since I took yesterday off too. I have been really taking it easy. which was the goal. I really was bumming and burnt out for awheil and I needed a couple days to do NOTHING. so I got them it rules. tonight we went to the <a href="http://centerstage.net/restaurants/golden-nugget-ravenswood.html">golden nugget</a> for some foods(it wasn't really good -  in fact it was <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1078019828-t610(2).jpg">kinda gross</a>) and then morgan and her friend kristen dropped matiss and I off at our house.. and we went to see <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1078023912-t610(2).jpg">ludacris, chingy and david banner</a> at the <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1078026937-t610(2).jpg">congress</a>. that was hilarious. I love going to concerts that don't fit my stylistic demographic. it cracks me up. we then came home and chilled out. ate soem left overs and wacthed <a href="http://www.freddyvsjason.com/?trailer">freddy vs jason.</a> now I am going to bed cuz I gotta get up early and go watch morgan at her <a href="http://isnow.com/">hair show</a>. hehe. the "outkast" is awesome. truly amazin. (i have been dropping the G from a  lot of ing words lately. I gotta watch that)
<br/><br/>i think I may have acquired <a href="http://nokia.com/nokia/0,,33210,00.html">a new phone</a>. we shall see. if so. it will be the second phone I have got in the last month. umm. I may have a problem. hehe. yea about that.
