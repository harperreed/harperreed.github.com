So yesterday my fathers surgery went without a hitch and he now has a cyborg heart. it rules - mainly cuz his un-cyborg heart was full of badnesss so it would have not been so keen on working much longer. cyborg parents are all the rage I hear. So anyway.. he is doing great. almost all the tubes are out. and he is sleepy.<Br><br/>it is weird though.. the move from immortal parents to immortal kids. it seems that somewhere around 20-25 (of course a sliding age) the parents pass on this idea of immortality to their children. umm<br/><br/>i have a LOT of work to do tonight.
