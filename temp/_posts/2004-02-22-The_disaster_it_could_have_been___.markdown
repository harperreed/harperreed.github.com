Last night was so dope. We, the <a href="http://www.thejugglers.org">J.O.D.</a> juggled at chris holmes' electro shw at te metro. it was sooo much fun. all my friends were there - and it was great to juggle with matt, matiss and brad. so much fun. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04">here are pictures</a>. The show was insane. first we started with some knife juggling while chris and aaron did their song.. then sparklemotion came out.. and did their thing. song three was <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20051.jpg">Brian Liesegang</a> doing rock you like a hurricane. Song four was the virgin tears song... and then song five was I wanna new drug with <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1077436735-t610(3).jpg">billy corrigan</a>. The show was really good - highlights being juggling on the metro stage - and the 15 minute noisey guitar solo by billy. rock. the who thing was so surreal and so awesome. hopefully we will get to do more show slike this. <br/><br/>it was also really dope - cuz I got to see a bunch of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20088.jpg">friends</a> I haven't <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20089.jpg">seen</a> in <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20108.jpg">awhle</a>. the best/worst was when amjad decided t pour his drink <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20103.jpg">on my head</a> - I should remember that he has that tendency. it was awesome to <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20080.jpg">dance</a> with <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20055.jpg">morgan</a> - and eventually we got <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20081.jpg">matiss and erica</a> out on the dance floor.<br/><br/><a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20006.jpg">i love corndogs</a>
