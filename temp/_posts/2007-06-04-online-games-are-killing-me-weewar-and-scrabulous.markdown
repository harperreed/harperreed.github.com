<p><a title="Have a little war at Weewar.com" href="http://weewar.com?referrer=harper"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="101" alt="weewar.com corner" src="http://blog.weewar.com/images/weewar_corner_1.gif" width="75" align="right"></a>So a couple weeks ago I found <a href="http://weewar.com?referrer=harper">weewar</a> and applied for an invite. Once I got in, I invited some friends. Then we fought our little wars. They were wee. Weewar is basically a turn based strategy game where you have little guy who have different roles. You attempt to capture your opponents bases and kill their men. I have never before gotten so many instant messages declaring "I am in your base, killing your dudes." So we played weewar a bunch. For about a week we played. I invited all my friends, played an assload of games - got destroyed, and then I got bored. </p> <p>Then my coworker Adam invited me to a <a href="http://www.scrabulous.com/email_scrabble/">scrabble game</a> over at scrabulous. OMG. So instead of getting work done, and instead of playing weewar - I just played scrabble. They have a really cool interface that doesn't require a password or anything to use the game. You just click the link that is in your turn email and bam. your game is rocking. I ended up inviting my mom, and my brother and some other friends. And after playing about 10 concurrent games and winning and losing a bunch. I decided to take it easy. </p> <p>So just when I gave up on the games altogether - I was awarded with a weewar pro account. Aargh! So then of course, I have to play a bunch more games and use the new weapons and cool new levels. </p> <p>I am giving up games from now on. Unless someone wants to play scrabble....</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:db8ebfe8-8dab-4ac0-a555-55f127ca77bf" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]weewar.com, weewar, scrabble, scrabulous, games, online, fun[/tags]</div>
