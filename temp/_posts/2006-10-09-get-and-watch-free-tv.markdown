title: How to get and watch free TV

So I canceled directTV awhile back and have been struggling to figure out how to easily download the shows I want to watch. I would love to do it legally. I have looked into the itunes solution - but they don't have all I need/want. And it won't work for hiromi - in japan. So I needed something that wasn't region specific and something that wasn't hard.

With these requirements I poked around quite a bit. Having looked into <a href="http://www.azaurus.com/">azaurus</a> and <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">bittorrent</a> with RSS. It was a pain and I couldn't possibly use it regularly. I also have terrible luck over time with azaurus. It rules when I have time - but when I leave for a week and comeback to it - I have no idea what's going on. So - I then looked into DDL sites. They were lame and too much work. So annoying.

I had great hope in the allsimps.com site. But it was taken down. weird I know.

Finally after looking and looking - I found what I was looking for in a video client that I had already looked into. I had originally downloaded and played with the Democracy video client years ago. It wasn't very intuitive. Or maybe I wasn't into it. But regardless - I left it installed and then stopped using it. Then a week ago I read the <a href="http://lifehacker.com">lifehacker</a> article about using <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/bittorrent/hack-attack-get-your-tv-season-pass-with-democracy-204057.php">Democracy and TV RSS feeds to stay updated on torrents of your favorite TV shows</a>. All seamlessly. it is pretty dope.

This is what I have done (it is outlined in much greater detail in the lifehacker article):
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Download</a> and install the democracy client</li>
	<li>Find your <a href="http://tvrss.net/shows/">favorite TV shows</a> at <a href="http://tvrss.net">tvRSS</a></li>
	<li>Add the RSS feed from the TV show listing to democracy</li>
	<li>Hang out for a minute (go outside and juggle)</li>
	<li>Watch your shows</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
I was taking about  30min to download each show - with some taking much longer. It seemed that it was reasonably fast - especially when ran at night. I now just have to remember to watch the shows. Luckily democracy will delete old and watched shows after a specific duration.

So now I can watch TV on any of my laptops. I do wish I could throttle the Democracy player a bit more. It seems that having it run only at night would be a good plan. The coolest part about the player is how it is a bittorrent client as well as a player - so the problem of people closing their clients after they are done downloading an episode is a bit diminished. woot.

I guess the next step is trying to get <a href="http://torrentocracy.com/documentation.shtml">this integrated</a> into a <a href="http://www.mythtv.org//">MythTV</a> box. I think that would be excellent. And after hacking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivo#Controversies">Tivo</a> to all its ends - I think its time to <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/dvr/hack-attack-build-your-own-dvr-165963.php">roll my own PVR</a>. heh.
