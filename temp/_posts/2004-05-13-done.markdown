ftp: 24154010 bytes sent in 1676.59Seconds 14.41Kbytes/sec.<br/>not fast<br/><br/>however I am really dumb and it didn't work. stupid ascii. I guess another 1600 seconds will do me good. anyway. when it is done. the pictures will be <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india">here</a>.  check them out. realize however that I practice shotgun style photography. for every 100 shots there are 5 good. so there will be about 15 good pictures out of the 300 I have taken. I will probably break it up into days or something. we shall see. <br/><br/>i will be publishing an entry that annotates the pictures when I am back(or maybe shortly in case my plane crashes).
