I am back. i have been back since sunday night - it was a trip. I really liked san fran and i really liked hanging with noah and the <a href="http://www.gravitymobile.com">gravity</a> guys. Nice. The office was super class and they are doing such cool stuff. I stayed in this dope hotel and ate at really nice places. 

So now i am working on some stuff. It is really fun. I really like RoR. so good. so easy. and SOOOO fun. haha.
