First off.. they wrote a <a href="http://classic.winamp.com/">good piece of software</a>. They wrote the original gnutella client and leaked enough info out for it to be easily reverse engineered and propagated. but AOL pulled it. they recently <a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/waste/">released a program called waste</a> that was <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/05/31/1259206&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=120&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=95">removed</a> from <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=9787">the website by AOL</a>. Since it was removed, nobody is <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=misc/waste">able to download it</a>. I really enjoy watching justin frankel totally fuck with AOL. What really gets me is this rather humorous post on <a href="http://winamp.com/news.jhtml?articleid=9961">DADD</a> (Dating Attention Deficit Disorder). I have no idea what that article is talkign about...  ;)<br/><br/>i haven't really been coehsive in my posts recently. I don't know why. I just haven't felt that they have really gelled. I don't know why. I also started swearing within them - which I haven't done in a long time(sorry mom <b>;)</b>). but whatever. I am tired today.
