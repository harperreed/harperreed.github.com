I have always wanted a digital picture frame. I originally thought that the <a href="http://www.audreyhacking.com">audrey </a> would fulfill my need - but it became apparent that i needed something much more powerful. I needed something that i could manage remotely and could run reasonable programs on. I needed a technology that would allow me to use open source software to display and manipulate the pictures as well as possible. I thought of using a custom linux solution - but decided that it would be cost prohibitive. I also noticed that there are a handfull of good picture frame tutorials already on the internet - so i checked them out and noticed a really nice powerbook <a href="http://www.applefritter.com/node/view/4971">hack</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.applefritter.com/hacks/duodigitalframe/index.html">apple duo</a> hack and got to thinking about my roommates old clamshell ibook sitting in the corner...

The clamshell ibook is a good choice because:
<ul>
	<li>OSX - it can natively run a lot of the apps i was dreaming about</li>
	<li>Small Form factor - it is already small and can get smaller thanks to Apples brilliant component design</li>
	<li>Good Screen - has a decent screen</li>
	<li>Heat dissipation - doesn't run hot</li>
	<li>Cheap - sub $500</li>
	<li>Ports - has airport(802.11), ethernet, usb and line out all built in.</li>
</ul>
So i went to it.

So around christmas time i flew to colorado to be with my family. I brought the remenants of my picture frame project from awhile ago to finish up in my fathers shop.

I shopped around for a frame that would be around 8x10 and would be deep enough to hold the mother board and such with the screen well enough. I thought about doing a custom frame, but i figured out (with dylan's help) that it would be prohibitively expensive. I eventually found two box frames that when stacked created enough depth to hold everything well. I then used some braces and some thick foam to hold the motherboard in.

It turned out really well.

here are some <strong>pictures:</strong>

<blockquote><img alt="Power Connector" src="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3815.jpg" />This is where the power connector hooks. I have drilled a hole into the frame. It is an incredibly type fit.</blockquote>
