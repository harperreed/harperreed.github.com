i can't seem to sleep. I mean. I did take a nap from 10:00-12:00 haha. it wasn't so much as a nap as much as it was an alcohol enforced sleep. heh. the plan was to have all of our friends meet us at the <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1082337540-Nokia6600(411).jpg">bar</a> that is really close to my house. it worked very well. we got there around 4:30 and left around 8:00. we had pizza there and bunchs of tequila shots. heh. at 8 or so I accidently got into becca's car and got ice cream. I then came home and slept for awhile. until I was woken up by crazy drunken jill. it was pretty fun. it is such a nice night out. like 75 degrees. I wish I was camping in the park nearby. wait. no I don't. I don't wish that at all. <br/><br/>in my non-sleeping I have been cleaning. I put away and folded my laundry. I ran around and cleaned up my room. I listened to explosions in the sky. sometimes I wish I coudl find the mix between isis and explosions. I think that would be the perfect band. it also might end up being pelican. which reminds me that I need to be reminded to goto the pelican show on may 2nd. with mastodon. it shoudl be good. <br/><br/>be prepared for our <a href="http://www.covetous.net">new project</a>. it will rock you.<br/><br/>things are good. this week end was ok. a little bit <a href="http://dylanreed.org/archives/000133.php#133">sad</a>. but it was ok. I saw pinback and enon on saturday. which was good. and I enjoyed a wonderful night at crobar on friday. how I love <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F170420040254&img=Nokia6600%28385%29.jpg">crobar</a>. <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F170420040254&img=Nokia6600%28389%29.jpg">felix</a> was spinning. as was <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F170420040254&img=Nokia6600%28387%29.jpg">dave da hustler</a>. it was a fun time. hanging out with cluadia, felix and the likehehe. <br/><br/>check out my <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F170420040254&img=Nokia6600%28370%29.jpg">new shirt</a> I got. it says geek pride. I am a fan. it is blue. I feel fancy when I wear it. I also got a bunch of american standard poloish shirts. I am excited for they are a lot more comfortable in the summer than the crap I already have. I gotta pick up some nice pants so that I can be business casual and stylin all summer long. whee summer. <br/><br/>i also got a bunch of <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1082231539-Nokia6600(401).jpg">new yoyos</a>. I think it is funny that a bunch is exactly 4. heh. I got a white hitman, a green speeder, a yellow sparkly night moves 3 and a lyn-fury. I really like the hitman. I am working on a bunch of new grindish tricks. and some good slack/whip stuff. it rules. we have been making lots of videos.
