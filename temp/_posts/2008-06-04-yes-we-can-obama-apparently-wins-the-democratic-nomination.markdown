After all the time and work we all put into his campaign, I am VERY happy to hear this news.

I am more happy that Hilary Clinton didn't win. She was really hurting my insides me with all the negative campaigning. I did not like how attacky she got in the end. I hope that she is done being annoying.

Now is the time to start supporting the Barack Obama, and the democratic party to defeat John McCain in November. Electing McCain is basically saying that you love President Bush and really want to fuck up the United States. I am not a fan.

The best part of having Obama be the democratic nominee is that he invokes hope in people, not fear. I am tired of fear.

Go donate money now.
