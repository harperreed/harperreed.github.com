<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/888324150/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1172/888324150_a1450e61d6_m.jpg" alt="The Items I Carry" align="right" height="166" width="240" /></a>The other day I was on <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> and I happened across a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thepaperbrigade/887687018/in/pool-theitemswecarry/">friend's picture of things that he carries in his pockets</a>. I thought it was really neat. He had linked to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/theitemswecarry/pool/">photo pool</a> that had a bundle of people following suit. It is amazing. I immediately took a picture of the things I carry around on me on a daily basis.

I don't have a lot of fancy things. No <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moleskine">moleskine</a>, no camera and no iPhone. But I do have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt%27s_Bees">burt's beeswax</a> - which everyone has. Hilarious.

When I posted my picture. I think there were around 80 pictures - now their are 280. awesome. Social software may catch on!

A couple friends have posted what they carry as well. Check out <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/proxient/900680283/">Mike's pockets</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/905254170/">Minnis' pockets</a>. Check out the rest <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/theitemswecarry/pool/">here</a>. You should do it too!
