I needed a quick break while working on <a href="http://www.yellowikis.us">yellowikis.us</a>. a site that is supposed to take over the world (we shall see... we shall see...) - so i fixored my blog. pictures and tags should work again and it should now rock. i need to tweak the theme a bit. make it less busy and then make it so the technology section is acceptable by 3gcoding.com. i really like <a href="http://www.jakenickell.com">jakes</a> site.

ok.

back to work.   i think i am going to japan in march. and then coachella in april. rule.
