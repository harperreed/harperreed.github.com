I am so tired today. I wish I was a simple web app designer. Soemtimes I don't really like my job. This is the first time I have used this blog to vent about my employment. I feel bad venting. But I don't have anywhere else to go.. ;). <br/>I am frustrated at what I see as unprogressive movement. It isn't necessarily anything that happened today. it is just that I get frustrated when certain actions and reactions were predicted and nobody notices. I feel under-utilized and frustrated. I wish that my title was changed to something that is more appropriate to my job. My description is Intranet developer. I have never developed here. I have never done anything like that. I have only architected. But I don't get credit for that. I don't get respect. I don't get anything... argh.. well in 5 minutes my views will completely change. <br/><br/> I want to try and get my CISSP certification. It seems hard. but I don't know. I just need a reason to do stuff. and right now I have no reason..
