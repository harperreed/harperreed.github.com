<p>So I got my computer set up at work. Its nice to finally be able to check email, catch up on my news and generally get my Internet presence back. Now that I can hang out on the Internet - work is starting to seem more like work and less like a crazy place. Everything is starting to come together. I can't wait for our office to be done. Its going to be awesome when we get our conference room, tables and other furniture. </p> <p>At some point we will have an office warming party. I will let you know. </p> <p>I gotta run home now. </p> <p>I think tonight I want to attempt to redo harperreed.org to be a better portal of my stuff. A place to showcase the music I listen to, the books I read and the movies I own. just a general. this is harper place. yea know. general. </p>
