title: i don't like this very much.
excerpt: |
  so. things didn't get better. that is for sure. sometimes I hate rationality. I wish I didn't have to speak in riddles and not make sense. today is my birthday. I am probably going to sleep a lot. maybe goto dinner. nobody knows. i need some rest. it was an eventful and unrestful night. i am kinda sad.
