Man. Today was pretty awesome. Woke up. Juggled. Ate good food. And wrote some dope PHP stuff.

After reading a bunch about some peoples PHP <a href="http://www.youtube.com/dev">Youtube API</a> implementation, I decided that i was tired of looking at some other peoples crappy and over complicated code. So i whipped up something that is really easy, works and is a class. I posted the code over at nata2.info - <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fyoutube_api">so check it out.</a>

I am warning you - it was written fast and dirty. I know it work, but i haven't tested all the functions. heh. just the ones I needed. I think the idea of writing code and not testing it is hilarious.

So after I wrote the class i made a quick and really stupid hack that I posted at flashandburn.net. <a href="http://www.flashandburn.net/youtuber/">Check it out.</a>

Then I went ahead and start part .5 of the <a href="http://www.geopoli.com">geopoli.com</a> idea I had awhile ago. I need to whip that up. soon

And now bedtime.
