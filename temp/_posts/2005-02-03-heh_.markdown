I come home from work and "read" a book and then wake up in the middle of the night. tonight I caught myself and woke up at 11:45. wheee.<Br><Br>i am reading these insane fantasy novels that matiss lent me. I don't usually like fantasy nobels - however these are incredible. they are called the "vlad taltos" books - the first being called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441385540/">jhereg</a>". they totally rule. I sometimes hate fantasy genre - but these are incredible. haha. I love dragons. and all that. <br/><br/>in other news - I am almost completing done with my site for work. this rules. however, it just means that I get to work hard on stuff like my dads site and howtoyoyo. its gunna be good.
