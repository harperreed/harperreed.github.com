title: MM and Britney
excerpt: So I went and saw Modest Mouse tonight. It was brilliant. Built to Spill was a lot better though. Which kinda sucks, because I don't get to see them again soon. However, I found a good link for yall. Check this out. Whoa. Wierd huh. Hey if anyone has any mp3's of B2S doing freebird I would love a copy :)
