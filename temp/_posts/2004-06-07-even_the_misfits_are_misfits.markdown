This weekend was pretty nice. I just hung out. watched movies. went to a bbq on saturday at my friend <a href="http://www.colepierce.com">cole's</a> house. it was fun. met some cool cats. after the bbq I went with <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A05_crobar_random&img=IMG_0552.jpg">elaine</a> to <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A05_crobar_random">crobar</a>. (of course. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A05_crobar_random&img=IMG_0554.jpg">jordan</a> met us and we hung out with <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A05_crobar_random&img=IMG_0561.jpg">red hair matt</a> - who seems to scare everyone who seems that picture. hah. it was fun. <br/><br/>i also posted pictures from <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A31_memorial_day">memorial day</a> and a random <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A29_sushi_wabi">sushi wabi</a> visit with hiromi and her friend. Hiromi now works at sushi wabi. which is cool. but with her working - I spend a lot more time alone. sad. <br/><br/>the last couple days I have worn some of the clothes I got from india. today it is this <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086625145-Nokia6600(870).jpg">nice "work" shirt</a> that is apparently "not my style." and then yesterday I was wearing a shirt that I modified to appear as "straight" as possible. it totally <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086562006-Nokia6600%28868%29.jpg">worked</a>. (i removed the sleeves and the collar - I rule).<br/><br/>i am now suppose to cold call this girl and ask her out. I am scared. I hate pressure like this. but whatever. I shoudl do it. what do I have to lose. maybe my arms and legs - when trip while on the phone on to the path of <a href="http://www.maggots.org/images/bus.jpg">that bus</a>. 
<br/><br/>i have drastically rearranged my <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents">pictures</a>. I hope not too many links were broken.<br/><br/>someday.. my punk little brother will give me pictures of his <a href="http://www.dopeman.org/dylanhoody">hoody</a> usage. and I will win. the prize.
