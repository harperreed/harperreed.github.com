so my computer broke. so I tested all the parts I could and detirmined that it is the power supply. which totally sucks. so I have to get a new one. this woudln't be that big of deal - but my laptop is also down. I somehow broke tcp/ip on it. totally blown. so I am stuck booting knoppix on the laptop and using my desktop keyboard, mouse and monitor with it. it is kinda funny. totally weird. I should bust out qnx. haha. <br/><br/>but yea. so tonight I stayed in. cleaned my room. played computer and watched black hawk down. I purchased it back in 2001 and never really watched it. so I finally did tonight. it wasn't a bad movie. I am a sucker for war movies. but they are sad. it was a bummer. ok. I think I am going to sleep now. nobody knows.
