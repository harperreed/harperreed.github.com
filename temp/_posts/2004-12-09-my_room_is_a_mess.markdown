I guess I get to keep both and see what happens.<br/><br/>i wish I had a vacation soon. only to pump out work. I need some time. I guess the weekend is coming. I shoudl just be super dilligent.<br/><br/>i don't know why I don't start a porn site. I mean. I have all the skillz. it would make me lots of money. it would rule. etc etc. wtf. hmm.. nobody knows. <br/><br/>i am currently reading rabbit redux by john updike. it is kinda sad. I guess I am unable to escape books like this. <Br><br/>i wonder what I will be wearing tomorrow.
