You grab a white box, and don't know which color, carts, etc you are getting. I didn't want to get an expensive mp3 player for my 5 year old daughter. I'm pretty happy since I already had an extra 512 SD card to put music on...plus pictures for her.  This (http://vugo.com), however, is what I really want for her one day when she gets a little bit older and this stuff is a little bit cheaper since it is not so proprietary.  You can do your own AVI, MPG-1, ASF, and WMV.  Also pix as BMP, TIF, JPG, GIF, and PNG.

  I have been looking to do this....the local Target still has a few on the clearance rack.  Do you have to do anything do get it to display the pictures from the card, apart from sliding the card in?  From the few posts I've read, I can't tell if you have to gain access to the device and modify code or not.
  
  If it just works when you put a card in, will it do a slideshow?

  In regards to where i got them - I picked them up off of the linux-hacker board. i would suggest there or possibly goiing to ebay. i thin i saw a couple of juiceboxes+mp3 kits for 30 bucks. which isn't too bad. granted it isn't 15 bucks. but it isn't the 50 bucks that target is apparently selling them for now.

  "Do you have to do anything do get it to display the pictures from the card, apart from sliding the card in?"
  
  All you have to do is convert the pictures to the format for the JuiceBox, and put them on the SD card. The Windows software included on with MP3 kit (that lets you use an SD card) converts images for you.

  All you have to do to get a slideshow is to hit play on the 'show all' selection on the picture menu. Hit the * button before starting the slideshow, and you can adjust the amount of time each image is displayed. (1 second to 1 minute)

  You are supposed to buy the starter kit ($35-$45).  It consists of an overpriced SD/MMC card to proprietary juicebox adapter. And software. Basically, the juicebox is ready to do everything you want it to. But, in an attempt to make more money, you're locked out of features until you buy the kit (SCAM!). There is NO good reason they couldn't just make them with SD/MMC ports. And there is no good reason for the juiceboxe's inability to view JPG images without converting them to JBP (juice proprietary format). No good reason = money for mattel.
  The good news. The SD/MMC has already been hacked and image converting software is available for linux. So, don't buy the kit. Save your money! It's not necessary.

  Yea.. the 37signals guys are pretty cool. I like their stuff.
  
  Well. I guess i feel that if a webapp has some exploits and the people who created the webapp are not interested in listening to problems with it - then those problems should be released. Not to exploit the webapp - but to make sure that developers see how security vulnerabilities happen and how they exist. This should and will allow people to develop better applications. EVEN the  37signals guys.. OMG.
  
  And it is obviously not about power. but you are right.. it is about <a rel="nofollow" href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/58461533/in/set-1264716/">being cool</a>.
  
  And.. i DO think that the community needs more people interested in talking about PROBLEMS and security issues within web applications. Especially if applications are targetted towards businesses and what not.

  The only way that we can grow these apps together is through pushing the limits, like Harper has done.  nata2 is right, too:
  
  "Security through obscurity is not security."
  
  At least 37signals are being transparent, sharing the API and seem at least willing to acknowledge limitations and holes.  
  
  We recently wrote <a href="http://42squared.com/2006/10/24/kumbaya-rubyosa-chatbot-for-campfire/" rel="nofollow">a bot mod</a> for Campfire, too.  Check it out.  Keep posting!

  hey, that pulse-modulation trick is awesome -- I did that back in 1992 on my Commodore 64's disk drive!  wow that brings me back.  Considering gumstix is a couple of ex-coworkers of mine, it's a small world.

  My favourite part of the Nabaztag API is the fact that you can get the current position of your rabbit's ears -- whether they were turned to that position by you manually, or by a command from the nabaztag.com website.
  
  Just use this URL:
  http://www.nabaztag.com/vl/FR/api.jsp?sn=YOUR_SERIAL&token=YOUR_TOKEN&ears=ok
  
  (Replacing YOUR_SERIAL and YOUR_TOKEN with your rabbit's unique values.)
  
  Then you should get html output like this (it's in French if you set your Rabbit to speak French):
  
  Here the position of the ears:
  					Left position = 14
  					Right position = 15
  
  It's easy to scrape those two values from the output in PHP using preg_match_all like this:
  
  $subject = file_get_contents("http://www.nabaztag.com/vl/FR/api.jsp?sn=YOUR_SERIAL&token=YOUR_TOKEN&ears=ok");
  
  preg_match_all("/[0-9]+/", $subject, $ears);
  
  // Latest ear position reported by API
  $posright = $ears[0][0];
  $posleft = $ears[0][1];

content: The instructions posted on the Nabaztag website (In English) are terrible! From what I can make out, you have to have a broadcasting SSID, plus use channel 11 of your wireless router. But what about WEP encryption? The FAQ's say it is supported, but it isn't mentioned in their on-line "documentation". If this thing will ever make it in America, the company needs to hire a tech writer who knows English!

content: Just wanted to let you know that I got it working again.  I had to reinstall the plugin and clear out gcal records in the mysql database, but now my dates are showing a day behind of the actual event.  Ex. A birthday that is May 21, will show for May 20th.  It seems that an all day event in gcal would be inputted as 2006-05-21 to 2006-05-22 with no time value attached to it, not sure why it would be a day behind.  If you have a non-all-day event with a time value, it works great.  Are you having the same problem?  If not, how would I go about fixing it?  Thanks

  Also, I tried the sidebar code as well and, strangely, only one item showed.
  
  Everything is properly 'shared' and I am stumped as to how to fix this! Please help! This plugin looks sweet and I'd love for it to become my only calendar on my blog!

  I tried gcal, it kind of worked... had some trouble with getting all the events to show... but my main problem is that it broke my lightbox.  I am using lightbox to view photos on the site and this quit working altogether... don't know what the problem is.  Any ideas?

  Hi, the plugin sounds cool, but I can't quite get it to work...
  I followed the installation instructions as far as "Go to the options->gcal".
  
  My Options->gcal link points to /wp-admin/gcal/gcal.php. When infact gcal.php is in /wp-content/plugins/gcal.php. But if I type in that URL directly I get "Fatal error: Call to undefined function: is_plugin_page() ..."
  
  Any suggestions?

  I remember when British dudes who were really into the Mo'Wax records label were all about Bape shit in the late 90s. It's really weird because it kind of seemed like it was a record geek thing to be into that stuff in the US.

  OpenDNS introduced its preferences screen today:
  http://www.opendns.com/prefs/
  Pretty simple, to start, but should be useful, and does let you turn off the typo correction (NXDOMAIN treatment).
  
  We're also improving the search results page you see if you attempt to load a domain which does not exist so that it's more obviously an OpenDNS served page (it is now, but we've heard the logo on the right isn't obvious to all) and why you got to this page is more obvious, too.
  
  We're in four locations in the United States. We did have problems in one location (Seattle) for a few minutes on Tuesday afternoon due to a rollout glitch. The problems were limited to the one location.
  
  We have not had any scaling problems, despite the rising usage: http://www.opendns.com/what/stats.php
  
  We're going to continue explaining more about how we flag a site as phishing and how we avoid false positives.
  
  Keep telling us how we can improve.

  I find it interested that people would condemn Israel while upholding those who either permit, encourage or turn a blind eye to the terrorists who help instigate the affairs of war between them. I am not a Jew nor an Arab. I have nothing to gain by supporting either group. I know there are excellent people in both groups and not so good people in both groups, just as there are in any group of people including you and me.
  
  I can only wonder what would be the attitude taken if a group of people decided they didn't like your group and set on anillating your group, decided to begin setting fires on your lawn, then to your house? Would you seek them out and simply ask them to stop it. Perhaps you might. What then would you do if they continued, continued and continued, then made a pact to anillate your?
  
  What if the goup was Hamas and Hasbolla, and your were the Israelees? Talk has been cheap over the years by those who would like to see Israel destroyed. Action has not be forth coming in stopping the terroristic attacks on Israel nor the pack to anilate them.

  well. 
  
  i don't think that either side is more right than the other at this point. i think that israel reacted a bit harsh (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_reactions_to_the_2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict it seems the world pretty much agrees).
  
  "What if the goup was Hamas and Hasbolla, and your were the Israelees? Talk has been cheap over the years by those who would like to see Israel destroyed. Action has not be forth coming in stopping the terroristic attacks on Israel nor the pack to anilate them."
  
  honestly your entire comment could be viewed from either side of this conflict with complete clarity. i think this is the problem for a westerner as myself with no religion or ethnic relation to the events. I can't identify with either side - however when i break it down in my head i see what you are saying. but i  it doesn't change if i were to say israel is right or the hezzbola were right. its all fucked. 
  
  that was the point of my post - although probably it leaned a bit more towards the hezzbola side. because it is easier to be mad at BUSH and our government when it seems to be supporting movements that will lead to an escalation of this conflict. i don't agree that this should be going down at all and would have loved to see the UN tell israel to chill out. not because i hate israel. but because i don't want war.

They're population is so High that they can afford this "Symetrical" warfare that dilluded idiots considers.  It was perfectly  fair for Israel to burn Lebanon to the ground.  Its Lebanon's fault for turning there backyard into Terrorist land.  This is the whole idea to what "Foreign Policy is"  its to enforce that people keep there lawns clean.  And as far as I know Israel can't afford to be fair. They are always at the brink of extinction so why should they? Israel wouldn't have to exist if the Arabs didn't drove them out of Arabia During WW1 in the FIRST PLACE.

  Hi there 
  
  interesting sources to synchronize  calendars, but how about directly syncing it with mobile? Is there a way to use Gcal with mobile? 
  I use online service zyb.com to save  and update my phonebook and calendars. They are also free and planning to integrate with google calendar. I inquired from support and they say it will be online soon. 
  Are there anyother options at the moment?

  Thanks for sharing your set-up . . I've done one extra thing that helps me still use my phone to create events. Here's how I've got it working:
  
  I use Gcal as my primary calendar. (Actually, my business partner and I are using the new Google Hosted service for our domain, so we can share calendars - works great!)
  
  I have four calendars set up within Gcal - Work, Home, Training, and Study. I subscribe to these calendars in iCal so that I can synchronise with my phone (Sony Ericsson w800i). In iCal, I've created an additional calendar called "PhoneEvents" which I publish to .Mac and subscribe to in Gcal. Then, in iSync, I've set it up so that events created with my phone are added to the "PhoneEvents" calendar. That way, I Gcal is always in sync with my phone . . and I for important events that need to be in other calendars, I simply re-create the event in one of my other Gcal's later on. I hope this all makes sense!

  Hi Harper
  
  Thanks very much for showing this to me and thanks Hayden for your extra tip about  creating a PhoneEvents calendar in iCal.
  
  I have found a private way of publishing the PhoneEvents calendar through iCal by using http://ifreebusy.com/ rather than http://www.icalx.com/ which only seems to work in public mode. 
  
  You publish to http://www.ifreebusy.com/username and then import the link to Google Calendar webcal://ifreebusy.com/username/work.ics?authtoken=xxxxxxx

If you have multiple iCal and Google calendars, you have to do these one at a time. That's the only bummer for me right now. Plus if I update Google Cal, there's now way to sync it cleanly with iCal.

  Hi all,
  
  I do have the same synchronization problem too. I use MS Outlook at work, and iCal at home. My thought was to synch via Google Calendar.
  
  Your approach is inspiring, but seems still too complicated to me.
  
  While researching I have stumbled over a program called GSync (http://sourceforge.net/projects/googlesync/). It looks promising, but unfortunately there are no releases yet.
  
  But an interface between iSync and Google Calendar would probably be more the Apple way of solving this synchronization issue. Has anyone found any similar projects?
  
  Best regards,
  Oliver

  Luckily my user information is my handle and nobody knows what that is...
  
  *glances at domain name*
  
  *runs to mac mini... changes everything*
  
  heh. 
  
  Honestly, I just use spanning sync now. It works better and is much simpler.

content: I hate stuff you have to pay for like spanning sync. The fact is that I choose gcal because it is free! now I have to pay money to properly sync it with ical. Well no go here. I rather pay 4 times at much for mobile me from apple! They offer about the same as google does (free calendar) and more, combined with push technology, so you will always have your phone updated 24/7! AND you get a 20 gigs online storage! I know it is "quite expensive" but at least they offer the real thing  and the full package and not just a simple program that does the trick.

  Busysync for OSX works perfectly both ways and does not use an intermediate server but sync directly between google and your Mac.

I was reading Wired Magazine and got the web address for a html based Flickr badge, and when I went to the site who's flickr badge did I see?  You guessed it, yours!  Anyways, good luck with no pop or snacks.  We should hang out again soon.  Talk to you later.

  I have an iMac G5 running tiger 10.4.7 and I an having a wierd problem. Whenever I go to a site that has an embedded youtube, flash or some kind of video, there is no sound. If it a quicktime file there is no problem. There is not sound no matter what broswer I use, firefox, camino, safari, or shiira. And keep in mind that about a week ago I was not having this issue.
  
  Help Would be awesome

  I Gmail account was hijacked</a>.
  
  I wrote Robert Scoble after seeing a post on his blog about someone else having a similar problem.  He forwarded my problem to Matt Cutts at Google.  Matt forwarded it to Adam Lasnik.  Adam (apparently) whipped the Gmail team into shape.  After a week feeling like a parapalegic, I finally got my account back.

  thought it was my beta firefox im using so tried IE but still same problem.
  sometimes can reply to a mail but not always, especially if there is an attachment in it...
  but gmail is fine on adsl so i know its not gmail themselves. 2 friends have also complained about their gmail on 3g today..

  Why is Halloween better than Sex?
  1. You're guaranteed to get a little something in the sack.
  2. The uglier you are, the easier it is to get some.
  3. It doesn't matter if the kids hear you moaning and groaning.
  4. Less guilt the morning after.
  5. It doesn't matter if they fantasize you're somebody else, because 
  you are.
  6. Forty years from now, you'll still enjoy candy.
  7. If you don't get what you want, you can always go next door.
  8. If you get tired, you can wait 10 minutes and go again.
  9. You don't have to compliment the person who gives you some.
  10. You can do the whole neighborhood!!

  Of course.. nothing is perfect. 
  
  The difference is that I know my site looks poor and that the nav is probably rough. But unlike wikipedia - i am not trying to make people think that i am an actual competitor in the content market. My site is just a blog. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that is attempting to beat out such people as WorldBook (my former employer where I WAS attempting to solve the problems I am bitching about) and Britannica. One of my biggest gripes is that they are attempting to be an educational site without actually doing the work that other competing and much smaller sites do to be usable by people who are not web professionals. 
  
  Also.. ;) I am updating and fixing my site constantly. Wikipedia hasn't changed any of the parts I have complained about in the time I have made a bundle of sites, redid my blog 4 times and had 2 jobs. 
  
  So I will stop when they get better ;)

  Hello, I'm a complete stranger. I like fukung.com a lot and love the simplicity of its design. I've got an idea of my own, and whether you wanna hear it or not, here it is (you can stop reading whenever, of course. This is the internet): I basically want to make a website that can be a depository for practically anything; be it movie clips, images, text, whatever. Just a repository for any creative thought that anyone might have. Versatility would be the key, as I'd like to be able to accommodate everything from character names and movie titles all the way up to full movie scripts, or even full movies! Obviously, the logistics of storing all this crap have nothing to do with the designer of the site, but I was just wondering what it might cost to get code as crazy as this into existence (if it's even possible, of course)?
  
  Going into more detail, I'd desire the ability to have tiers of tags; ones that affect each entry on a bottom level that go by content, which would be user-supplied, and then larger categories which would be applied automatically by media type, as well as manually but moderated, like genres, target demographic, and so on.
  
  A User system would be necessary to keep track of whose ideas are whose, and to sort users by their talents/desires.
  
  This all sounds like way too much to fit into one site to me, and I know that a common frustration of people involved with realizing someone else's idea is that the person supplying the idea has absolutely no clue what of their plan is feasible and what is impractical/impossible, so really what I'd like to know the most is where this idea aims too high as far as the coding is concerned, or if it is all practical, how much such a thing would cost to develop.
  
  Probably the thing foremost in your mind (I think it would be in mine if I were you) is "why the heck is this dude coming to me spouting ideas and asking for advice?"
  
  I don't really have an answer for that, but the idea I have for this site works sorta similarly to fukung, just a bunch crazier, and also I just got done writing about in my underground 'blog thing that me and maybe five of my close friends ever read, here: http://norock.no-ip.org (consequently, the entry you'll find there has a lot of detailing about what I'd want this site to be).
  
  I realize it's risky to put forth concepts, but when they meet the right people, sometimes those are the projects that really change the world (like youtube or google or whatever), and that's what this site is all about. Maybe you'll take my idea to a company who wants to do something with it and make a lot of money off it, or maybe you'll dismiss it as something not wasting time on. Maybe you'll never even read this far! If you do, I'd appreciate a response. Thanks a lot!
  
  Curt

  2. I am not surprised you are doing this.  it seems like you do everything to the extreme... lols
  
  ps- Not saying your design skills aren't amazing, but if you ever want a little sum'sum' I would like to throw my hat into the ring.

You can't bring on nail clippers but I guarantee someone could get a plastic slingshot on, or a plastic shiv, oh and you can bring bottles of booze on board too which could be broken and used as a weapon.  I mean wtf, a SHOE is a better weapon than nail clippers. So stupid.  I think my favorite experience was when me and Jake went to New York shortly after 9/11 and i was sitting there using a pen to write something down, and this huge guy sitting across from me who was obviously the air marshall says to me, "Nice pen, did you know they make pens that are weapons?" And then continues to just eyeball me for the 2 hours left in the flight. Stupid TSA

  I love to twitter, but I rarely have time for it. I wrote this program so I could quickly write a twitter post with only a few keystrokes. You should check it out.

  It is open source too. 
  
  I really love the idea of having it update your im status, I started working on it but didn't get to far. I was having trouble setting the status while not away. The only way I could work with the oscar protocol was through the oscar plugin for perl. Of course that is not an option because its hard to distribute perl on non linux boxes. Its really out dated too. 
  
  Well anyway,
  I would love to see you get this working, I think it would be a hit in the Twitter community.

  two thoughts on the film:
  
  1. first thoughts [hour or so after viewing] yeah! jesus malarky! right down to the foot washing and self sacrifice...
  
  2. [after reading your post] a corollary of the divine comedy? inferno / hell= "modern" life in england is hell, mindless monotony and punishment for any stepping out of line.  the idea of living a free life while actually being controlled and monitored at every step.purgatory= refugee camp, pretty obvious... caged up, things actually seem as though people are surviving despite the shite situation...paradise= the boat is salvation and rebirth.
  
  interesting [to me at least] is that the novel on which the film is based [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Children-Men-P-D-James/dp/0679418733/sr=8-3/qid=1168330789/ref=pd_bbs_3/102-6087965-9708128?ie=UTF8&s=books" rel="nofollow"><i>the children of men</i></a> apparently doens not contain any of the "leftist" message of the film [haven't read it but intrest is rising...
  
  that's all for now, they need to make unlimited movie passes so you can go re-view new releases.  go read the imdb boards on it to have some chuckles.

  Harper, 
  
  Great synopsis on setting up a blog. Good point about using Askimet...One thing that I've noticed is that som hosts disable editing your WordPress blog from the admin and rarely give access to .htaccess, which can be a problem and throw a 500 error and the eventual support call. This happened to me with one host when changing the permalink structure from ID to name based...Great article!

  I guess i have ran through most of the softwares... I host sites for friends - so i want the easiest and least painful way to allow them to blog. 
  
  With that said: I used to love movable type - and when it came out i migrated all my friends to it - from greymatter. MOvable type was amazing and easy. It just worked. I still have friends rocking it as a content manager. It is amazing and robust. But eventually i realized that it was causing crazy load on my servers - it being perl/cgi and what not. 
  
  So i started looking for alternatives. I found wordpress around the same time that movable type went pay - and i haven't looked back. I think that wordpress is a bit harder to use off the bat. But it is just as featureful. 
  
  Now in regards to services like typepad and wordpress.com - i think that you can't really compare it. There is nothing like hosting and running  your own blog. However, some great blogs are on those services so obviously it isn't bad. i just like to think that its mine... 
  
  hope this helps

  Harper,
  
  How, in your opinion, do you rank Wordpress to other services such as TypePad, MoveableType, etc.? I get this  question all the time when people inquire about a blogs and blog software. I've only used Blogger and WordPress, however, would be interested to hear your take on the issue. Seems to me that a lot of sites on TypePad, MoveableType, etc often have the same look and feel, although I assume that most are general users and dont bother with customization. Just wondering.

  i think that as a developer, windows boxes are just much easier and more cost effective to use.
  
  plus, you know damn well that nothing about mac is cheap.  the OS may be cheaper, but vista will come with PCs that still sell for super cheap.
  
  macs will continue to be expensive because they are pretty.  and when you buy a mac, you usually purchase all of your accessories separately - all of which are also pretty so they are expensive.
  
  and even worse, you will become a mac head and end up buying every accessory they offer.  shit you may even buy the same mp3 player 6 times.

  The OS X you pay is pratically an upgrade, because when you buy a new mac you already pay OS X in its price. So those 149$ and 199$ you pay are simply upgrades, because you install them on computers that already came with MacOS/OS X.
  
  Also there are OEM and upgrade version, and since most PCs come with windows people would simply buy an upgrade.
  
  By the way, vista home premium upgrade costs 149$, just like OS X.
  
  Really, if you want to make vista look bad you'll have to invent something else...

  I haven't got the time (or intrest really - I'm a mac user) to review the Vista specks too hard, so I just go with my knowledge of XP versus OS X.
  
  Mac - Comes with the OS lightyears ahead, with software bundled along. Pretty expensive, but man, it works and you got the software you need all out of the box.
  
  PC (with a Windows OS) - Comes with an OS that's pretty god damn lame (no seriously, think about it, you have to tweak it every two seconds and it crashes all the time) AND you still have to buy all the software you need separately.
  
  So, I've been using a mac for about 3 years now, and the total cost of it was 1200 euros. I also bought a new PC at the same time, the specks was pretty much the same with the mac and it cost me 900 euros (windows xp incl.). But here's the deal:
  
  With the mac I had all the software I needed, and the OS updates was painless - it automagically downloaded the patches, so I didn't have to worry about that. With the Windows PC I went thru Hell downloading all teh hotfixes & shit. And it STILL crashes every other second, got full of viruses etc, I had to spend extra 400 euros to get some serious firewall & antivirus software. With mac I had not these problems.
  
  I mainly have used the PC for gaming, cause that's all it's good for. Well, I bought a Nintendo Wii and sold the PC. I will never ever go back to windows again. Mac is truly worth it's reputation.
  
  But don't take my word for it, try it out for yourselves. The more people switch to mac the more game and software developers notices the trend and starts to develope more and more stuff for macs.
  
  Windows is out cold.
  
  I pitty the fool who spends his/hers money on that crap.

  Francesco: If you are going to be comparing OSX and VISTA you should probably be comparing the most similarly capable products. So Vista Ultimate at 299 (i will subtract 100 to make it an upgrade) versus OSX at 149. So the price difference isn't 50 bucks.. its more like 150. 
  
  so i guess my point still stands. 
  
  I don't really give a shit if vista looks good. i know i  will be using it at work and probably at home. My point is that Microsoft is out of touch with consumers and apple isn't.

  derek: What accessories are you talking about? what does an iMac not have? I will admit the pro desktops don't come with a monitor, but other than that, what accessories do you need to buy that come in a standard PC bundle?
  
  josh: apple does come out with a new version every year or 1.5 years. Which is incurred cost I agree...Each apple release has included new features, etc. Wether you feel it justifies the price tag is your prerogative... but the fact that MS failed to release an upgrade to its main product for 5 years is NOT a feature. I am amazed that people think that is a good thing..
  
  I mean, that is like pointing at the guy that has a new car that has more features than your car and saying 'ha ha- you bought a new car! My 5 year old car still runs! I just have to wrench on it a lot'...
  
  And seriously, have you installed XP lately? AFTER you install SP2, you still have like 60+ updates to install. Really? 60? It is nuts. And that is AFTER you installed all the stuff to get through SP2.
  
  I am not saying Vista sucks (although their ad campaign does) since I haven't used it. But for 5+ years of development, it had better be good. Or at least... something cool.
  
  I am not sure MS is out of touch with consumers. I mean, I know they are, but... I think consumers are out of touch with reality. I can't think of another product people use as often as a computer that has such a long product cycle. The automotive sector operates on a shorter product cycle than XP has, and that is a MUCH MORE expensive item then XP to the consumer. The average young person changes jobs more often than 5+ years. The average young person MOVES more often than once every 5 years.
  
  And yet, MS has been rocking out in relative mediocrity for over 5 years. Awesome.

  I've decided to buy a Mac laptop for my next primary computer.  This is a big deal as I've used windows since version 3.  The reasons vary from fatigue with windows to its new insane price structure with umpteen versions.  
  
  When it took 5 minutes just to shut down my winXP dual core, 2gb nearly brand new work laptop today, I realized that Microsoft is just wasting my time. I don't expect the Mac to be a "holy" experience, I just hope its not as irritating.  Windows just slowly pecks you to death with small annoyances.  I think Microsoft is quickly wearing out its welcome with many users.

  I did forget about the mini... it doesn't have anything. But, that being said, it is the ONLY mac that doesn't.
  
  The iMac comes with everything. The laptops come with everything. The desktops come with everything aside from a monitor.
  
  So I picked the mac that comes with everything and you picked that mac that comes without the keyboard and mouse and monitor.

  Well, the Mac Mini's purpose was to be a "switcher" computer -- one for someone who may have a PC already. All of the computers Apple is trying to market to the mainstream consumer are either iMacs or laptops.
  
  Francesco's right on the upgrade pricing -- each Mac has the base software cost built in, and anything else is an upgrade. Realistically, most Vista users will want Home Premium or Business, which are $159 and $199 at upgrade price, respectively.
  
  If Microsoft is attempting to be "cool," it's by distancing themselves from their main brand, if anything. The Xbox division is being given projects that attempt to hide their Microsoft logos (Zune), <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/default.mspx" rel="nofollow">Expression</a> is supposed to be Microsoft's new creative suite to compete with Adobe and there's already evidence of them <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/57972#1562739" rel="nofollow">tampering</a> with the market. Why? 
  
  I admittedly do the majority of my development work on Windows (at work) since I'm usually too burned out to keep messing with programming when I get home, but I'd love if I could use Mac OS in both places. 
  
  For what it's worth, I jumped ship to Mac OS X from Linux as my "main" operating system in late college when I picked up a laptop. All of the programming, network tweaking, unix crap, and scripts that I had set up jumped with me pretty damn easily. The "coolness" factor of Apple was still pretty low since that was around the time the iPod came out and OS X still wasn't that widely adopted. 
  
  There's something to be said about the quality of tools and the joy of using them. I mean, I've used a Lawn Boy to mow the yard, and I've used a nicer one that was probably not as economical when it comes to just cutting the damn grass, but I know which one I'd choose most of the time.

  Get a mac. Feature for feature the mac hardware costs about the same. Sometimes less. Apple simply does not sell a $379- loss leader that you realize is a piece of sh!t 43 minutes after plugging it in. Sure, they come out with an expensive upgrade every year or 2. But the mac os from 3 years ago is comparable to this vista garbage being foisted on you today. Don't be a sheep. After 7 years, my desktop runs Tiger & all its features- well. Try that with vista.

  I switched to Mac because I was tired of having the same operating system for five years.  Also, every review says that Aero still isn't as smooth as OS X Tiger.  Vista is going to slow down gaming, which makes an awesome gaming platform in my book.  And for Microsoft with all of their concern for backwards compatability won't run current versions of iTunes or Nero well.  In any other industry, new would hopefully mean more efficient, but just to run the operating system as it was intended will require an upgrade for just about everyone who isn't an extreme gamer, and the extreme gamers only gain from the addition of DirectX 10, which so far no games are built for.  I like my XBox 360, but I'm never going back to Windows for a personal machine, and I will only upgrade the business computers I am responsible for when XP support goes away in two years.  
  Also, for anyone who bitches about Mac prices, price a Dell vs. an iMac with all the same features (processor speeds, RAM, hard drive, video card, and don't forget the included flat panel monitor).  Macs are comparable if not cheaper.  Of course, Gateway is cheaper than both, but who wants to own a Gateway.  Macs are more expensive because currently they are better (hell, they even run Windows XP).  Cool factor and better hardware make the switch worth it

  I used to be an avid PC user and still am at work unfortunately... I bought a G4 Powerbook about 1 1/2 years ago and I won't be looking back... True, I could have gotten a Dell or HP laptop for less, but I wanted a computer that would work, and not one that I had to keep messing with all the time.  My G4 just works and works all the time.  Not one crash, not one problem, ever.  It doesn't freeze up, I don't have to reboot it when some program decides to screw up and it's just simply a pleasure to use.  So, for me, the fact that Apple has a superior OS over Windows is worth the extra price.  
  
  I love listening to the MIS guy I work with telling me how much better Windows is as he's fixing yet another PC in our office that's crashed.  
  
  It's interesting that whenever I hear someone complaining and bitching about their computers, they're always always always talking about a PC with Windows.  I've never heard one Mac user talk about how his Apple is a piece of shit... but I sure hear that a  lot when it comes to PC's...
  
  Simple as this... If you like Windows, then stick with them... I have no problem with that... but please stop trying to convince the Mac users out there that Windows is so much better than Apple... Apple users know better...

content: Hi, first I have to say that your blog is really nice and informative. As for the Vista, I think it will just drag the users away from it. First due to a high price tag and second would be  that Vista is quiet demanding for what it offers ( which is nothing). Many people would consider switch to mac because OS X is a very stable and  Intel macs can rub both Mac OS X and Windows XP. Keep up the good work man...

  Macs are good for editing movies, but only because there a simple fast system.  
  
  As someone who plays games, I like the windows program and the vista is a good gaming os.
  
  I also will say I like the feel of windows more because The format seems just better.  Also having a mac is like telling people I'm computer eliterate.

content: I'm surprised to see that barely anyone touched on backwards compatibility of existing software. Esp since other developers were making comments here. Essentially what we are saying is that Windows XP while different than Windows 95, generally has to maintain the quirks of the operating system down to MSDOS. M$ maintains a developer group, whose sole job, is to create mimicked bugs of the operating system, through the compatibility layer. Sure this can be a royal pain the ass sometimes, but rarely has compatibility been broken with Windows as it has been with MacOS in general.

  I have been working on and fixing pc's for over 15 years now and no matter how often I have to fix one, I'd still use a pc over a mac. "Why?" you might ask, because a mac will never hold a candle to a pc when it comes to gaming. Macs have only saturated 10% of the computer market. Which, logically, would mean that they would have 10% of software titles available to them. I remember when Halo came out for PC, able to run on a 733MHz system and 128mb memory. Two years later it came out for Mac, requiring a CPU speed of at least 1GHz and 256mb memory. Not only that, but the 1 button mouse made playing with the standard mouse / keyboard config virtually impossible.
  I was on the beta team for Vista and I must say, they DO need a LOT of work. Running on a 3.2GHz 2GB 4200 DDR, 250GB sata drive with a 512mb 256bit gfx card, it lagged. Much like when XP first came out, we waited a good year or two before upgrading from 2000. Most IT techs will probably do the same and wait until Gates decides to correct the majority of the issues.

  You cannot compare Vista Ultimate and OS X, they are two different beings, one thing being is that Ultimate has alot of stuff that OS X doesnt even bundle, like MCE, ready boost,bit locker etc.
  
  The only version of Vista that is comparable to OSX is Premium and even that has MCE which OS X doesnt have an equivelent too. 
  
  And please we all know that ever since OS X has come out every year or so you have to pay for an upgrade to it. So if over a 5 year span you spend 500 dollars on an OS for the MAC, what exact cost savings is there over Vista Ultimate which has free update over its entire lifespan?

I'm looking for a new computer and am dying to know if my peripherals I have now on my pc will be compatible with VISTA if I upgrade.  When we looked at upgrading to a new iMac, we discovered that we needed to purchase a new scanner and printer because our old ones are not OS X compatible.   Well, now I've recently purchased a printer/scanner for the pc.  Will it be compatible with VISTA should we decide to go that route?  I'm not looking to spend the money on upgrading an entire new system - I just want something that is faster, has a lot more memory and will make my life easier, not more stressed!

In the meantime, it looks as if Apple will be poised to release 10.5 before this actually sees daylight (in any mass-adoption sense). The next iteration of OS X looks to have some amazing things built in. Microsoft just keeps trying to catch up, in my opinion.

  I would have to agree with the mac. I am presently deciding between the mac and pc for my laptop. As of now im swaing towards the mac. Easier, and can also run Vista. If you really want to spend that much money on it. Over looking both systems patterns seem to start coming out. Apple are leading the technology bringing improved software out, every 1 - 2 years. Every 5 years microsoft is starting to play catch up. Athough I have not made my final choice yet. PC may still be best for running auto-cad. However its still possible to run on the mac using xp or vista. However I found that the Mac system is actually cheaper than the pc market. Apple just make the high quility stuff at a low price. Where PC have a range from poor to high quility.
  Oh and PC much better for gaming. But what kind of nerd sits down and plays games all day. GET A JOB, PLAY REAL SPORT. Damm come on gaming is not cool. If you are really that nerdy, get a life, not another computer.

  "Not only that, but the 1 button mouse made playing with the standard mouse / keyboard config virtually impossible."
  
  Dude - so spend 10 bucks on a two button USB mouse - yes - even then Macs accepted two button mice... And yes - I am posting this from a Windows machine - a beast laptop (yes laptop) with 3.4 (yes - three point four - yes in a laptop) Ghz pentium 4 processor and a 256 SDRAM nVidia gfx card and a gig of memory. It runs games like an x-box - and can run about a gazillion programs including photoshop, illustrator and flash simultaneously without even slowing down. Why am I telling you all this... - well frankly I am about to buy a mac - I have to for business reasons - as a web developer/designer I need to be able to develop applications that work on both - and to be honest, I will probably end up installing windows XP on the mac and using it if an intel core 2 duo with 128 gfx card, and two gigs of memory will handle the above programs in a similar fashion. I will not be upgrading to Vista any time in the near future because I have tested it and it just isn't that great. There are a few neat navigational features that were improved - start menu, folder to folder navigation - but IE7 - what a joke - where did they put the refresh button...oh lets remove it by default? Good thing I am a keyboard shortcut guy. I'm ready to spend 150 bucks every couple of years (as I understand it you get two upgrades per purchase? - correct me if I'm wrong but I read that somewhere earlier today) Vista is playing catch up w/ Mac OSX and even with Linux in some areas... sad really. And all the different versions - what a crock - I develop applications myself and yea - that's how developers can make money - build an application that you can strip/disable features on and then charge the client/customer to get those features - so yes - Vista Ultimate (aka Vista Useful) is a rip-off and Home Edition isn't worth wasting your money on. In XP - the start menu actually has a registry item where a delay is set for how long it takes to appear after you click the start button.... You can change it to be much quicker. I wonder how many things they did in Vista that are similar in nature. In XP home, networking was painful to say the least - professional was much easier to configure - how many things like that did they do with Vista? Your average home business person won't need things that would come w/ Media Center so let's split them apart - but wait - now I need to buy a whole new computer (or dual boot) to have some nifty media features... - with a mac it's all included regardless. I don't think there is much of a comparison there folks.... just a slaughter-fest against Windows....

  nope, as a tech who frequently repairs PCs I have absolutely had it with microsoft and Vista which is a nasty OS. I currently work for a school district who in it's wisdom decided to upgrade it's servers to Vista from XP without checking the hardware properly.  The servers crashed and we were forced to revert back to XP.  The servers also were less than 1 year old.
  VISTA demanded too much of the hardware to run properly even with what it was said to be compatible with... which turned out to be false. 
  
   Bottom line: after seeing the poor quality of Vista and the high quality of OS X 10.5 ... I am making a formal recommendation to switch over to Apple. I am nothing short of impressed with their products, and for those people who argue about the initial cost of the OS .. let me put it to you this way... $149 non student edition/$99 CDN Student  OS X 10.5 has FAR FAR more capability out of the box than VISTA has at current. 
  
  We wasted money on faulty PC hardware every year when we could have gone mac and had few hardware repair costs, not to mention
  the save in AntiVirus software and a few other areas... all this money could have been used more cost effectively.   :( 
  
   Very sad indeed!

  Harper, I've been crusing your site - first landed here because of your T-Amp aricles.  I really like your article on setting up a BLOG for your friends.  
  
  So here's my adsense question - can you give an idea of the type of moneys in round numbers that you can get from simple sites?  It's hard to see from Google just how easy/difficult it is to make $$.

  well. i honestly never made that much money from adsense on blogs and what not. always under a dollar a day. maybe like 10 bucks a month (with a bundle of sites). but honestly the key is to have solid traffic and solid legit content. that will get you paid. otherwise its up in the air. 
  
  For tips on how to monetize your blog - check out johnchow.com. He has a lot of really good information on how to monetize a simple blog.

  I posted this on the DesmoineRegister because i was so pissed off.
  For the record, ISL is a non-profit organization, but that only means this: whatever money they have left after deducting expenses, they get to keep. However, they are exempt from taxes because their status is non-profit.  The only way they have an issue with the government is if they do an audit and find that they actually do have a profit and administrators keep a large portion of it.  
  
  Here is my personal account of my dealings with this loan entity, and if they treat a borrower as such i have to question their methods and justifications on a larger scope.
  
  After having left my previous college, ISL had put me under less than full-time student status. After enrolling full-time at a different, sending them the same forms they requested numerous times (i think 8 in total, 5 through regular mail and 3 via fax) and they insist they have not received the forms. No only that, when i tell them i have the receipt from the post office that certifies that someone in their department has received it, they repeat the same litany, "I'm sorry sir, but we do not have that on file. If you would please send it to us again i am sure we will receive it." During this time, of course, my status has not changed and i am still making payments even though i am a full time student and full time working. On 3 occasions i had the school call them directly to verify my in school status, which ISL adamantly denies even though i was right there in the registrar office when they made the calls, and on 2 occasions i requested that ISL call the school to verify my student status. Both times i called back immediately to see if they actually called or not and both times they LIED because i called the school on my cell phone and they confirm that no calls had come in from them. Recently, in the span of 2 weeks, i called to confront them and why they treat me, a borrower, as such. All three times i called, the representative hung up on me, one time right after saying that line "I'm sorry sir, that is not my problem and you should be actively concerned with your own account information."
  
  THERE IS SOMETHING VERY WRONG/SUSPICIOUS WITH THE WAY THEY ARE RUNNING THINGS.
  
  A year and a half later after i had left my previous school and enrolled in a new school, ISL has my information as STILL ATTENDING MY OLD SCHOOL!!! If they treat me as such, what do you think their opinions are of YOU? Then is it so hard to believe that ISL would use bullying and misrepresentation/misinformation to obtain YOUR tax money for THEIR profit?

  i read about wesabe a while back... i'm still a bit scared of this kind of thing.  sorta for the same reason that old people are scared of using credit cards on websites - dammit.
  
  i mean, i am comfortable viewing my bank information on my bank's website.  but it seems a bit too low scale to have the lead developer of a site managing my finances to be posting comments on our blogs.
  
  i dunno.  i feel i have my finances fairly under control and managed... but as anyone else, i feel they could be better.
  
  i like web 2.0 stuff just as much as the next guy, but with my money... i feel like i trust corporate more than trend.

  I do think the bot is an awesome way to do it. 
  
  I envisioned functionality as being:
  
  !twitter this is my update - to update twitter
  !twitter follow user
  !twitter really any twitter command
  
  and then allow the channel to post tweets on topic change
  
  then have the tweets be pushed into the channel. So it would be two way. My hack was horrible.. i am probably going to redo it in python - in a sec ;)

  I was thinking about writing a irc->twitter bot that would send a tweet to a given user based on search terms, like your nick.
  
  I actually started thinking about writing an XChat plugin that would send Channel Hilights to twitter, but then though how cool it would be if you could have a bot sit in a channel and have users able to subscribe to alerts that the bot would tweet them on.
  
  Don't know if I'll ever get around to it or not, though :)

  Yeah, I was thinking it should post tweets from users it's following in the channel. Nice little script though - can't wait for the Supybot plugin (with following ability :P)
  
  I'm sure there's a way to do it - just check the twitter server every few minutes or so.

  300 was so one-note that it never really went anywhere! Meanwhile, you should check out Ronin, which is probably the only Frank Miller graphic novel I wish someone would make into a good movie, but in fact it'll probably be fucked up for the big screen at some point. It sidesteps the majority of his stereotypical and testosterone-deluded crap and actually does a good techno/fantasy/futurism thing. Search out a post on the blog gravestmor for some good commentary.

  I liked reading the entries in the blog and was thinking: - Hey man, that's nice to read some random and sometime clever thoughts from a programmer about this and that - and the layout is nice. I'll bookmark it.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  But I ended in this post: 'New Theme' because I was curious about how the theme was made. \r\n\
  \r\n\
  And the final reply from the author: - \r\n     I think you guys should shut the hell up. !!!!\r\n     punches to all\r\n\
  \r\n\
  I don't get it. Is it a joke? - or is it just a 'standard american method of communication'?\r\n\
  \r\n\
  Grab of cup of coffee (not that thin caffeine-free\"#\xC2\xA4), do a polka-dance and give your girlfriend some more kisses. Why so negative?\r\n\

  Hey I just wondered, since you've already started hacking your Chumby... I was thinking of getting one but then I found out they push spam widgets through the channels which sounded a bit sucky (don't they know advertising is anti-social and evil?)
  
  So since you got it to boot a different flash app, does that mean you're now free of the Chumby-network and the ads. Can you basically just point it to the url of any Flash movie on the net?

  I love the suggestion halfway through the DHH post where he implies that this would be a great opportunity for the twitter people to contribute, like it's your RESPONSIBILITY to contribute to the community when you encounter a scaling problem. This is basically the nightmare that every corporation throws out whenever someone recommends open source solutions that leads people to stick with large vendors. Not that large vendors are responsive either, but there's that mythical culpability.
  
  Ideally a company that is enthusiastic about the technology meets the framework developers halfway, but is it wrong for me to think that you should be able to wholeheartedly use and endorse a technology without taking on its development when there are others out there?

  I have to agree quite a bit. I have a love hate relationship with Ruby on Rails too. It seems really nice and does a lot of stuff for you, but it is slow compared to my PHP apps, even apps built on bulky frameworks like Drupel. 
  
  I'm going back to PHP for new development, but I'm taking a lot of the concepts I learned from Rails (as well as some J2EE concepts) and making my own little / simple framework that is more tailored to what I need it to do. 
  
  Ruby on Rails is a nice box and a good environment to try to force programmers to write good MVC code, but try to build outside that framework, or interface with non-ruby databases and you get a lot of issues.
  
  Also, I rather write my own SQL that use Active Record. I like writing SQL and looking through the logs, I always feel I could write better SQL than what they auto-generate. 
  
  PHP has been out much longer and there is so much stuff out there for it that still works in PHP5 even though it was intended for 4. Rails is poorly documented, the same stuff in Rails 1 doesn't work in Rails 2 and the community feels as arrogant as the Debian junkies.

  I agree that rails is slow.  It really is.  I think Ruby itself might even be fast, but somehow rails manages to slow it right down.  Or maybe it is Ruby, I'm not sure. 
  
  Also I really agree with the quote that rails is good but "if you get big enough rails will suffer."  It will indeed.  Thankfully, however most e-commerce sites don't get slammed, so rails actually honestly is fast enough for them.  Though I suppose it's a little disconcerting what you noted about php being faster so getting more clicks.  Wonder if it's the prototype .js's or something.  Just my $0.02

  Hi,
  
  Thanks for the information!
  
  While doing some tests I placed the UPLOAD_IDENTIFIER tag after the file tag and that doesn't work.
  It might help others if point that out.

I think I have installed the extension correctly but uploadprogress_get_info($unique_id) just doesn't seem to be returning anything. Is there a way to verify that the extension is installed and working? My php version 5.2.1 (Ubuntu 7.04, apache 2) so that should be ok. And when I viewed phpinfo, I could see the extension listed there. Any idea?

  I dot this thing working with a little tweaking, and the damn thing is brilliant. Here is my implementation. I find it simple, but thats because it fits into my custom MVC. Please note I am using jQuery for client-side DOM manipulation, and xAjax for Async requests (upload progress).
  
  MARKUP (upload.html):
  	
  		<input name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" id="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="" type="hidden" />
  		<input name="UPLOAD_IDENTIFIER" id="UPLOAD_IDENTIFIER" value="" type="hidden" />
  		
  		
  	
  	
  UPLOAD PROCESSOR (processUpload.php):
  	
  	
  	
  	
  		
  		
  	
  		window.parent.fileUpload.finish();
  	
  	
  
  
  JS HELPER (fileUpload.js):
  	$(function(){
  		fileUpload.init();
  	});
  	var fileUpload = {
  		timer: null,
  		timeout: 800,
  		iFrame: null,
  		init: function (){
  			$.xajaxLoad({bind: false});
  		},
  		start: function (el){
  			$.xajaxLoad.show();
  			this.checkProgress();
  			this.iFrame = $('#' + el.form.target);
  			el.form.submit();
  		},
  		checkProgress: function (){
  			var fUp = this;
  			if ($('#xajaxLoad').size() == 0)
  				return false;
  			if ($('#uploadProgress').size() == 0)
  			{
  				$('#xajaxLoad').append(
  					''
  						+ ''
  						+ '0%'
  	//					+ '0kb/s'
  						+ '* Seconds Left'
  						+ '<a href="#" rel="nofollow">Cancel</a>'
  					+ ''
  				);
  	
  				$('#UP_cancel').click(function(e){
  					e.preventDefault();
  					fUp.iFrame.attr('src', 'about:blank');
  					clearTimeout(fUp.timer);
  					$.xajaxLoad.hide();
  				});
  			}
  			xDoUpdateBytesSent({
  	//				avgSpeed: 'UP_avgSpeed',
  					timeLeft: 'UP_timeLeft',
  					percent: 'UP_percent',
  					percentBar: 'UP_percentBar',
  					id: $('#UPLOAD_IDENTIFIER').val()
  			});
  			this.timer = setTimeout('fileUpload.checkProgress()', this.timeout);
  		},
  		finish: function (){
  			clearTimeout(this.timer);
  			$.xajaxLoad.hide();
  			alertSaved();
  		}
  	};
  
  XAJAX PHP FUNCTION:
  	public function xDoUpdateBytesSent()
  	{
  		$info = uploadprogress_get_info($this->getParam("id"));
  		if ($info)
  		{
  			if (($asDiv = $this->getParam("avgSpeed")))
  			{
  				$tmp = wmFileSystem::bytesToHuman($info['speed_average']);
  				$this->xajaxResponse->addAssign($asDiv, "innerHTML", $tmp."/S");
  			}
  			if (($tlDiv = $this->getParam("timeLeft")))
  			{
  				$this->xajaxResponse->addAssign($tlDiv, "innerHTML", $info['est_sec']." Seconds Left");
  			}
  			if ($this->getParam("percent") || $this->getParam("percentBar"))
  			{
  				$pDiv = $this->getParam("percent");
  				$pbDiv = $this->getParam("percentBar");
  				$tmp = floor($info['bytes_uploaded'] / $info['bytes_total'] * 100);
  				if ($pDiv)
  					$this->xajaxResponse->addAssign($pDiv, "innerHTML", $tmp."%");
  				if ($pbDiv)
  					$this->xajaxResponse->addScript("$('#".$pbDiv."').css({width: '".$tmp."%'});");
  			}
  		}
  		return $this->xajaxResponse;

One advantage of doing it this way is that irssi+bitlbee run 24/7 in screen on my server, so it would work all the time. The only problem is that I'm not totally sure how well bitlbee supports status for all the IM protocols. I think it's pretty decent, though...

  How bout one of each!!!
  
  I have loved both my thinkpads (ibm T20 and lenovo T43p) but strongly desire a macbook (had one, liked it). For me the major deciding factor was trackpoint vs. trackpad (I prefer trackpoint so went with thinkpad, but if mac had it, would have gone mac for sure).

  If you go with a Thinkpad, I would get the X60s bluetooth version or the normal x60 with the integrated Verizon broadband access.
  
  They also make an X60 Tablet, and normally I would say tablets blow... but this one has a multitouch display, which is amazing.

  I've heard great things about the IBM laptops, but I decided to buy a macbook about two months ago. It was the right decision for me. 
  
  My last laptop was a Dell Inspiron 15", but it was a beast. It was easily 3x the weight of the Macbook, and about twice as thick. So much for portability.
  
  Anyway the macbook is just really light and easy to carry. Installing programs on the Mac is sooo easy compared to PC, and it really does respond very quickly. Plus there are some really cool Mac-only programs like Omnigraffle and Coda.
  
  My favorite part about having the macbook though is that at the end of the day I am running bsd, which means I can use vim to modify my local apache config file, or test my bash scripts before putting them on a server, or setup a DSA public key for passwordless SSH auth (with Keychain: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20011128174701140). All the benefits of a *unix os, with a better GUI.
  
  Get the mac.

  Go with a Mac if you want arguably sexier hardware and the ability to test web stuff in Safari and run Boot Camp for native Ubuntu/Windows installs.  However, I'd wait until the LED backlit LCD screens come out this summer.
  
  Go with Thinkpad if you just want to run Ubuntu/Windows.
  
  Both laptops have ATI graphics and ATI's Linux drivers blow.  Nvidia's Linux drivers are good.  Either way you go, max out the RAM.

  i am still lost ;) I do think that the mac is edging closer and closer. And Gil's point is very very solid. However, the IBM seems like it would be a bit more powerful (but this is just cuz the more ram and bigger faster HD is cheaper). 
  
  btw - i HATE safari. seriously - worst browser ever. except netscape 4.07 and IE (all versions) ;)

  I love the macbooks too... but sometimes I feel claustrophobic while I'm on a mac... sometimes just thinking about using one... not because I'm not good with them because I know it very well... it's just weird...
  
  On the other hand macbooks feel safer and more durable than anything else, what I mean by that is I would trust it a lot and not be afraid of it just going crazy or whatever.  I have been thinking about this same thing because I am wanting to get a laptop as well...

  This is a no brainer Harper, get an IBM/Lenovo T60 Widescreen. The IBM's have both Trackpoint and Touchpad; Trackpoint is the best mouse for laptop use. Touchpad's suck!!!
  
  If the mac had Trackpoint I would say get that because you can then dual boot it, but they don't so there.

  i have no opinion on the macbook, but i just took an IBM t42 on a business trip and quite liked it a lot.  it's a few years old and not quite a t60, but it ran everything i wanted it to really nicely.  it had a gig of ram and was probably about 1.5ghz.
  
  for what it's worth, it performed much better than my gf's toshiba which she got just a few months ago, however she has much less ram.
  
  plus it's funny how people react to the IBM case.  they always think it's old based on it's matte square design and simplicity.  everyone's like, "that thing is ghetto" when in fact it probably performs way better than the curvy "cool" looking dells and such.

  I'd go for IBM because that's what I use and it's durable, their warranty is good too -- I've had my screen replaced after I got back from Burma and the service was excellent. I take it with me almost everywhere too.
  
  But mac's more 'chic' I guess. They look a bit soft for me. I mean have you ever dropped a mac? I've dropped my Thinkpad and it's ok. Oh I've had a worm take over too and I didn't loose data. IBM has this behind the scene stuff that you can go in and take out your data thingy. In my friend Hamish's words "It's built like a tank." That's why I got it and I'm using it.

  i bought a black macbook/2gb 11 months ago, and i am still very impressed with it's power and the smoothness with which everything operates. i don't really use any of my windows or linux desktop systems any more. it did take a little getting used to, and osx certainly is not perfect. but it's a very sweet system, both h/w- and s/w-wise.
  
  in no particular order:-
  
  - it's intel - i run parallels when i need to. 
  - it's unix - tools. interoperability. compatibility. dependable.
  - it's secure - worry less about virus/malware.
  - it syncs contacts/cal very well - my phone has never been so useful! 
  - it's low maintenance in so many ways - get more done, more easily.
  - windows laptops? - oh yeah, all that again.
  
  my 2p worth.
  
  i've been a software engineer for ~20 years - and nowadays i make a fair bit of money doing windows pc support for the average joe.

  Its always nice when youre looking for a new laptop. It means you can get the latest features and capabilities, along with the ability to work faster and more efficiently. I get my laptops and peripherals from Portable Universe and I can thoroughly recommend them. The best thing for people to do is to talk to them, let them know what your needs are (both current and future) and they will come up with the best laptop for you.

  Yeah, I really hope it does influence things here. In a way, it makes no sense that it shouldn't be available to anyone that should want one, though I suppose it might be due to limited availability of certain parts used, etc.
  
  Are you sure the b&w part of the display isn't just regular lcd like in a PDA? Because I remember mine being readable in direct sunlight. I forget if it was just the black or all the colors that worked in sunlight, though. I actually read some novels on my PDA on was surprised at how it didn't strain my eyes like I thought it would. Still, faster better eInk would be great..

It sounds like a good idea for people who can afford it to have 1 donated for every 1 they buy... Its kind of like how Little Ceasars pizza used to be - you pay for 1 but get 2... only in this case you pay for 2 and get one. Someone else gets the other one who would not be able to afford it... such a great concept.

  there was a place on ashland just south of belmont that used to do that before they closed, that yellow hippy place that has since been painted white. Technically, they just facilitated it, but you would get a basket of whatever was in season. Rebecca and her old roommate caroline used to do it. It was cool. That was a few years ago.
  
  you could also get unpasteurized/unhomogenized milk, but you actually had to purchase part of the cow and then go pick it up. stupid laws.

  Wow. Chris - i think you really hit it on the head. Why are they concentrating on rails and other things when they could concentrate on making their sites stay up. 
  
  The other week mysql was down for 3 days. I have ran many mysql servers and some of them really big - and i have never had one down for 3 days. Especially when you have rackspace as your partner. Of course, we don't know all the details - but still 3 days!

I host everything out of my house on a business class cable connection, but I don't want a bunch of noisy, expensive servers sitting on display when I try to sell my house this summer, so I need to either shut them down or move them to a colo.  I don't get why Mosso can't sort their issues out.  If they would spend less time making their system support stupid ruby on rails and more time improving reliability, they would be way better off.

  It doesn't sound like it'd be best for your needs (probably not enough control and not as economical for a high bandwidth site), but I feel like I should give a shout out to nearlyfreespeech.net.  Their claim to fame is charging only based on actual storage and bandwidth usage. So you put money in the account beforehand and if it runs out, it temporarily disables the site until you add more $.
  
  I think a lot of the hosters out there prey on people's egos. You pay $20+ a month for all this storage and bandwidth that is never actually going to be used (and if it was used, they'd probably kick you off). With NFS, I had a couple of test sites going where $5 lasted a couple of years. Now that I have some wikis and other stuff up for the public now, it's still cheaper than a monthly plan would be. And if something did get dugg or /.ed, I could buy a bigger "bucket" of bandwidth at a cheaper than normal rate to hold the tide over..
  
  Plus it has a nice community in the forums and not much downtime that I've seen. But not as good a deal if you're constantly using a lot of bandwidth since it'd start to add up. They do have bugmenot.com on there, but that may be due more to them willing to support a bit of a grey-area site.

  Thanks for your thoughts Edward. I have heard great things about serverBeach - and the idea of not having full control of the server kills me. The one thing i worry about the unmanaged boxes - is that the bandwidth will kill me. But i guess i just need to check it out. 
  
  I feel as though i have just been broken up with, and my friends are telling me "don't worry - there are other fish in the sea." but instead of fish they are talking about servers ;)

  Yeah, you do get what you pay for to a certain degree. That being said, the first generation of 'ultrascalable' 'shared' general purpose grids being offered by the likes of MediaTemple and LayeredTech are plagued by reliability problems. Its not an easy problem to solve because you have no control over the application. These companies have no control over the quality or maliciousness or integrity of the applications running on their shared grid. How do you deal with a $10 mosso account that has an application that opens 50,000 MySQL connections? How well can your forkbomb scale?
  
  Colocation is nice, but dealing with the inevitable hardware failure gets iffy. Plus, these days there are plenty of reputable companies that will give you a very stable dedicated server(s) that will give you similar flexibility levels. There is no need to pay Rackspace level pricing unless you NEED a lot of hand holding when it comes to the admin side of things. Go with a quality unmanaged server where they are responsible for hardware, os reinstalls, network, etc (and dont lose sleep over a power supply failing). Companies I'd suggest for this would include Voxel.net, Softlayer and ServerBeach. There are more out there but these are three that Ive got a lot of experience with firsthand at a lot of different consulting gigs.
  
  S3 and EC2 also look pretty interesting, but have also had a lot recent availability issues. The trend is definitely moving towards these sort of 'on demand' hosting services, but the first generation has made me advise all my clients to stick to reputable dedicated (or even 'dedicated virtualized') infrastructure -- at least for another year or two till things get really solid out there.
  
  My 2.1c,

  I haven't really changed my mind. I don't host anything mission critical for myself. But i attribute that more to me being a tweaker and not mosso being poor. I do host a lot of my friends blogs there. and other sites that are quite important. I still recommend them. 
  
  I am 50% on and off with them. but they have DAMN fine support. and the people who run it are amazing. so there is that.

  Harper, I was wondering if you have changed your mind since then. I've been using them since June 07 and though they have had issues they have made many improvements and seem to be doing better each month. While I still run a dedicated server (w/Hostway) I hope to move everything to Mosso to avoid the headache of managing a server. 
  
  To Pete - honestly...i've never seen better support than with Mosso and I"ve used serverbeach, Affinity(before the buyout) and Hostway.
  
  I'm just curious how your story played with with them. And no I'm not an employee or fanboy, just a happy customer.

  Hello, Harper;
  
  I'm a semi-retired teckie in Canada trying to set up a WiFi-mesh over an adult community of 700 seniors.  I bought some Meraki units just before they switched to a 3 tier marketing system.  Trying to convince old-folk to let me build a Wifi cloud around them is tough enough, but now the price of entry is tripled and the "legacy" networks will be obsolete within a year of deployment.  Yes it is "gee-wiz" technology but with a catch.
  What is your take on the new Meraki business model ?
  Having all control in California, puts network builders at great risk.
  That's like buying a house on a land-lease arrangement with rent going up every time the landlord desires.  I prefer freehold.
  By the way, I financed my daughter through Optometry school in Chicago, so most of my retirement money went into your neighbourhood.
  I need cheap WiFi solutions that are stable.

  Hi Dieter, 
  
  I am not happy at all with meraki's new pricing structure. I think its stupid and annoying. It alienates their users and causes them to be just another mesh solution - but without any hook. I had great hopes for them. We are looking for another provider. :(

I thought about going with Meraki but then I found these guys.  The cost is cheaper and they won't charge you for the software, infact you can still get your own gateway and configure these bad boys.   With Meraki you may have to pay for software to manage the nodes in the future.  Meraki will not allow you to manage nodes outside Meraki website.  (EVER)

  To me the movie did not present any sort of balanced opinion.  It was black and white, socialized rules and privatized sucks.  There must be plenty of stories from Canada and beyond about how their health care failed them but he didn't even present that as an option.

  Ayn Rand eh.. I really don't think that idealism based around a utopian world is where you should be baseing your critique of sicko ;). If you haven't noticed - we don't really live in the world that Rand's books are based in. We have people here, not robots. The commenter on your site was right - even communism worked on paper.  
  
  In regards to sicko - I liked it. I felt that Moore wasn't saying that socialized medicine wouldn't work here. It seemed to me that he was saying that it would work - but our leaders are too in with the huge conglomerates to think about socializing the medicine. 
  
  But regardless of what you thought about Moore and sicko - didn't it seem really strange that the prisoners in cuba are allowed to have great health care - whereas our friends who can't afford it are not allowed to have great health care?

  This is what I wrote about the movie after I saw it last night.
  http://www.schalicto.com/2007/06/20/michael-moore-hates-america.html
  
  It does expose a lot of crap in health care and politics but most of the movie was a complete waste of my time.
  
  He seems to be saying in the movie "Health Care in the US sucks because our government sucks and socialized medicine probably wouldn't work here anyway".

  Robyn, Know what you mean. <a href="http://www.photodork.org" rel="nofollow">Sarah</a> has been throught the healthcare ringer and we are still getting screwed. 
  
  We even got charged for an IV that they didn't open or use they just went and got it from the supply closet. It was still in its sterile package when we left the emergency room.
  
  Hospitals are bastards

  Knowing that I have "affordable healthcare" makes me sick if I let myself think of it.  Last year I spent $3,333, a number it looks like I'll surpass this year.  This year I've already spent $1,460 on copays, hospital bills, and prescriptions on top of what's deducted pre-tax for health insurance.  This also doesn't include the $350 I'm know will be billed to me for the month physical therapy I haven't paid anything on.  Nor does it include the eye exam and new lenses I've been needing for a while.
  
  Sometimes I'm all down on myself for not having savings or more money considering I make a lot.  But then I look at all my fucking medical costs and I'm lucky that I've been able to afford to live without maxing out credit cards.

Here you have Moore perfectly laying out the health care system in Canada, the UK and France...all of which have universal health care at no cost to the citizens. Sure, their taxes are high, but are ours. I especially like how Michael Moore points out a lot of things that are socialized in our society that I've never really thought about: libraries, the police, firefighters, public schools."

  I had the pleasure of watching this movie and I must admit... the more movies I watch of his, the more I love Michael Moore.  Sure, he's a sensationalist and portrays a completely one-sided view of a topic, but how is that any different from any other content source?  Not to mention, he portrays it in a matter that provokes conversations and discussions.  
  
  Regardless of how it's portrayed, it's quite painfully obvious that if you've helped at Ground Zero and you've suddenly found yourself with unaffordable health care costs - there's a problem with our system... or perhaps just the administration of the system itself, i.e. in different hands, the system can succeed.  I just went on Google finance and tracked these corporations like Aetna, Humana, etc against the S&P and it's pretty ridiculous.  Something must be said if they're profiteering on death.

content: I just saw the movie last night and I loved it.  I liked the fact he took us to the different places where universal health care does work and we can have it here.  I was especially touched when he took those firemen to Cuba and one of the medicines the woman needed was $125.00 here in the US and 5 cents there.  Her tears are representative of a lot of US citizens who are elderly and have to choose medicine over food.  On a personal note I don't have health insurance and I did hurt my foot from a fall.  I tried to pain it out but couldn't.  My husband took me to the emergency room they x-rayed my ankle-that bill was $39. which i paid, the doctor told me it was a sprain, she put my foot in a sprint, her bill was $338. the hospital bill was $1100.00 and we are talking about a total time span of 45 minutes for everything, because this was at 5 in the morning.  The fall happened at midnight.  You know we as Americans are working 8 hours because on May 1st, 1890 every worker in this country sat down, they shut the country down for 3 days.  It began in Chicago, Workers of the world unite, May Day began there in Chicago. We can have universal health care we just have to demand it and not take no for an answer.

  I guess that if you want to get a view of how the health care system screws over the average american and doesn't have a soul about it let me explain to you how it works:
  
  At the time this happened both my wife and I where working forty hours a week. Sarah got sick, really sick, what she has isn't important just know that  she went to the hospital for a week twice in a year as well as having to go see a specialist 60 miles away. 
  
  The insurance that we had at the time was average, not super fancy but co-pays where ok, deductible was ok. After that year we had around $20,000+ in hospital debt that we in no way could afford. So we applied for financial aid to help us.
  
  We where denied. Flat out denied, because we both had jobs and insurance. Plus it turns out that the aid that we where able to apply for would have been a one time payment of $100.........thats it. 
  
  On top of that we still have all of the prescriptions, one of which isn't covered by any insurance. That drug alone is $350 a month. 
  
  So, yes Michael Moore may be a hater on the government, however I agree with him. Sure health care may suck in other countries, however I don't live in those other countries. I live here and if this movie gets enough people to push for health care reform I will be happy. 
  
  I pisses me off that my wife could get better, free health care if she made a car bomb and tried to blow up a building or just threatened to do so.

  the City office where you file a complaint against them is right next to my work building.  tuesday i went and filed an official complaint.
  
  fucking comcast.

  I'm a comcast employee, actually thats not true I work for an outsourcing company and right now we've been whored out to comcast. I can understand the "pain" you very very important people must feel everytime someone over the phone doesn't bend over backwards for you. giving you promotions and free channels and services. or when for some reason we don't take the word of a customer, who has had no training in the field of cable and internet, who is telling us the prob is not in their house. I can imagine that a customer may think all is well in the house because they haven't touched a thing and it was all working a second ago. but that doesn't always mean an outage. and there is no way a customer would have the tools to tell us how to do our job. We get yelled at and put down evryday and I have been called a name about three times already.
  and thats just today and I started an hour ago. do any of you know how disgusting you are? crying and yelling about the cable? hey hey now, I get it, things in your life go wrong and  cable and internet going out is the last straw. but just think, we are not here to be your personal punch bags. nor are we equipped to fix everything. no one is. and no one will. and no one wants to be nice to someone who is insulting and trying to sound like they know everything. customers don't want to deal with rude customer reps, and customer reps don't want to deal with rude customers. just think about guys, cable and internet is not the entire world. deal with it.

  I would deal with it - if it wasn't obviously incompetence on the part of the techs i am dealing with. Come on. If someone a rep makes a mistake - and costs me a week of internet (which i am paying for) should i have the right to be angry. 
  
  BTW, i ALWAYS attempt to be courteous. I have done support, and i know that users are a pain in the ass. So i make sure that i get angry at Comcast. Not the CSA. 
  
  And thus this post.

  I completely feel your pain. The last 4 months I was in Florida, our internet went out about every 7-10 minutes. It would drop, then come back. In that 4 months, we had 30+ technicians come out to the house, only to say "I'll let my boss know what I've found" then leave. Of course, their boss never heard anything from them. So, I moved, and it's still the same song and and dance with them now that I'm in Georgia, however we actually have a connection that sticks. The only problem we're left with is we have to reset the modem every few days because our connection keeps getting slower and slower. Sigh. 
  
  Verizon FIOS, I want you in my area!

  I used to hate Comcast now I despise them. They raised prices left and right over the years for their overpriced and low quality service.   
  
  In my area they took the NFL network from the basic package and set it up as a premium channel.  That was the last straw. 
  
  I canceled my service on July 23.  They have now billed me for August, September and October saying that it has not been disconnected from the pole. I don't know what to do. I don't us their service but they keep billing me.  They even sent a collection agency after me for money I do not owe.
  
  I will watch nothing before I use them again.

  Agree with you, Harper.  When I first got Comcast Digital, I had to have my HD/DVR box replaced four times within the first month.  The initial appointment to bring out the stuff was jacked up (tech had the wrong stuff).  
  
  As far as HSI goes, we've got such an unstable connection in the Sunnyvale, CA area it's ridiculous.  A tech came out and did his thing (the problem again wasn't in the apartment, but outside it), and we still experience massive slow downs.  They are in the process of upgrading our area big time because the system is so bad we don't even get half the HD channels nor OnDemand.

content: First if after the first time the problem is not fixed call the BPU and log a complaint every single time that you have a problem. The number for your local BPU is at the bottom of your Comcast bill. Second whenever your call make sure you are speaking with a local rep in your state and if so ask them to hit the emergency record button so your conversation can be recorded. Comcast does not record every single call, they record calls at random. If all else fails and they still have not resolved your issue call the corporate office and lodge a complaint; their corporate office is in Philadelphia.

  The seat is netted like the aeron. We have super nice padded chairs at work. They are awesome - but the padding gets all matted down and what not. So some of the chairs suck now. 
  
  True, its only 150 bucks more - but i was pissed about spending 800. so that 150 was important.

  is the mirra padded on the seat or netted like the aeron?  from the photos i've seen the seat looks almost padded, which is what always kills me.

  Radiohead is un-abandoning the labels and shopping for a major to release the new album in CD form in Jan 08. On top of that, there will probbaly be more songs on the actual RIAA-published disc. 
  
  Originally I had pegged the radiohead thing as a simple marketing ploy, but now it appears to be a marketing ploy AND a money grab. nice.

  Dark and Brooding? Get into the late Romantic Era composers. Wagner, Elgar, Bruch (Violin Concerto No.1, everything else from Bruch falls flat)...  Those guys are pretty much nothing but brood and whine. Beethoven's last works fall in there, too.
  
  However, if those are too heavy for you ("wait, this isn't what I meant when I said 'classical' and 'dark'"), there's always film scores. You'd be surprised how many dorks think they like classical music, but it turns out they're really just into scores for films and video games. Really, don't kid yourself. I thought I was into IDM at one time, turns out I just wanted to listen to  Gabber/Hardcore.

  hmm, not too classical, but recently i've gotten into a contemporary of john cage named charlemagne palestine.  the two works i have from him are "strumming music" and "continuous sound forms"
  
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne_Palestine" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a>
  
  <a href="http://bloodistruth.blogspot.com/2007/06/tomb-for-boris-davidovich.html" rel="nofollow"> link to "strumming music" download</a>
  
  nic could likely open your eyes to some goodness in this realm as well.

  I'd recommend "Music for Prague, 1968" by Karel Husa.  I have yet to find an awesome recording of it, but managed to pick up a few university recordings on eBay.    
  
  the back story is pretty interesting:

  Totally agree, except that I might be a little more favorably inclined toward OSX. I haven't done lots with it, but it seems like a pretty fair balance between Unix and prettiness/convenience. Honestly I kind of feel like this is basically the same place Ubuntu is headed. Before trying Ubuntu, I've used Slackware, RH, Debian, Gentoo, OSX (not to mention SunOS, Solaris, IRIX, HPUX, OSF/1, AIX, etc.). So I have a pretty good amount of Unix experience, and honestly I am SUPER impressed with Ubuntu on the desktop. Debian on the server and Ubuntu on the desktop is working really well for me right now. I rarely have to compile anything big, but THANK YOU to the 1990s for teaching me how to do it in a sane way and keep things manageable. :)
  
  I hope I never compile the Linux kernel again. Also I hope I never download anything onto 80 floppy disks ever again.

  Ubuntu is awesome!
  
  I run both Ubuntu and Solaris on my laptop.  Solaris is my prmiary development platform, quite understandably.  
  
  Have you tried OpenSolaris yet?  Give a shot at Indiana.  It's not close to Indiana in terms of usability, but, with technology is far superior, and if you're a serious developer it should really get you interested.  Two of the most important innovations to get integrated into Solaris:
  
  1. DTrace - http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/
  2. ZFS - http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/
  
  No wonder, OSX Leopard has got these two features ported, DTrace for their XRay UI and ZFS for their Timemachine feature.

  I'm glad to hear your happy with Ubuntu...reading this post is exactly what I needed to push me to install it on my Thinkpad. I downloaded the iso sometime ago but haven't installed it yet. 
  
  I agree that the Mac interface and applications are optimal, but am also annoyed in the tucking away of the underlying os. I've been using two laptops for a year now, a Thinkpad for documents and spreadsheets and a Powerbook for coding and everything else. I really just want a single machine that does both really well and think that the Mac is the 80% solution for now.

  Hi Jeff!
  
  Yea. i have used macports and fink on OSX before. It was awesome. But i always found myself dealing with weird path issues - or not finding something i was sure i had installed. It just wasn't as smooth. 
  
  I have not installed apt on any other linux boxes - although i may start doing that to defeat the evil YUM. 
  
  In regards to my success thus far - i am happy with it. But i have been working hard to get vmware working for a couple tasks that i require windows for. I will probably have to buy workstation again - because fucking vmware requires separate licenses for windows and linux. wth. its not like i can use my windows license when i have linux installed on my compy. I may attempt to use qemu

  Heh, back in the 90s you *had* to compile everything, especially if you were into the new software coming out, because
  1. Package management sucked and only half-worked
  2. Everything was changing so fast that new packages weren't released nearly often enough
  
  And yeah, slackware was the shit. The base system was what, eight floppies?

  Today AT&T sunk to an all time low when a employee called for my Grandmother and would not explain the reason for her call to my son and myself. When Jason asked to take a message for her as she is Deaf she responded "Then she dosent need a phone" I took over from there when she requested my grandmother return her call I stated she was blind and unable to call back" I was just told she was deaf"!!! At that point she told me since my Grama would not take the call she  considered the call refused. Is this even legal??

  Harper - I blame you for writing this damn post.  As much as I agree with you, I also agree with sliceMatt.  As a consumer, I want to know what went wrong and why, as long as everyone is honest - I can make my own decision about who to blame.  
  
  As for 37signals, I think that if they're blaming their service provider, as Fitz points out, they're to blame for putting all their eggs in one basket - albeit a generally big, protective basket in Rackspace, but a single point of failure nonetheless.  Even in DHH's comments on TechCrunch he admits that Rackspace's hardware agreement has long since been broken.  Umm, I'm not a smart man, but if that's the case, um, why are you still with them (and since you are, why aren't you mirroring crap?)Without either a backup service, or a Google Gears type of app, they're the ones to blame.  Hopefully, the customer can see this. ;)

Granted we serve a very technical community, but the explanation you outlined in your response would not fly. They would rather hear exactly what broke (insert technical jargon here), how we'll prevent it going forward, no matter if it's our fault or not. I think 37signals has a similar user base and perhaps reached the same conclusion.

  I totally agree. I think it's an in-group/out-group thing. From the user's point of view, you and your hosting company are one entity. The right thing to do is to represent the whole group and take responsibility. If you want to sue them behind the scenes or get them to pay up according to some SLAs or whatever, go for it. But don't try to put yourself on the customer's side against "them." It's condescending and kind of shitty and nobody buys it.
  
  Obviously this is what you mean by 'black box'. So yeah. I agree. Take responsibility for yourself.

  The 37signals thing bummed me out. They delicately phrased their communication so that it sounded like they were taking the blame, but when you read it closely, they are actually blaming Rackspace for taking 2 hours to replace a failed piece of hardware. The fact is that hardware does fail, and you can't reasonably expect them to replace it much faster than that.
  
  The transformer thing was a totally separate issue, and it sounds like Rackspace hadn't been keeping up with their backup systems to make sure they were working properly. Hopefully they learned their lesson, and I won't discredit them unless it happens again.
  
  I've had my own frustrations with Rackspace, but after the fact they've always gone out of their way to fix the problem. I still refer people to them on a regular basis, and will continue to do so in spite of the 37s/tumblr nonsense.

  Hi Gil!
  
  I think that having frustrations with vendors is totally part of the game. It happens to everyone. It is just a bummer that people are so into passing the blame onto someone else - instead of taking responsibility. 
  
  i think that blaming is easy and a bit thoughtless - whereas taking responsibility is usually hard and possibly shows weakness (because it is YOUR fault instead of someone else). 
  
  but yea. rackspace has had a couple rough spots with us too. but they are always quickly resolved and remedied within a day at the most. and usually they do not cause downtime. so regardless of tumblr and 37signals bitching about how bad it is. i will also continue to represent them in anyway i can.

  As a partner at Slicehost, we take the responsibility of keeping our customers' servers running very seriously. Everything outside of customer control (power, cooling, server hardware, network) falls on our shoulders, not yours. 
  
  I've been on both sides of this equation - as a service provider trying to get customers back up and as a customer at the mercy of a service provider. There isn't a worse feeling in the world than having to tell your customers you know what the problem is, but someone else has to fix it.
  
  37signals accepted full responsibility and explained what happened. At some point we all have to trust someone else to do *their* job, sadly they appear to have been let down.

  Hi Matt. Thanks for the comment. 
  
  I agree - at some point we do have to trust someone to do their job - and i agree that it is a harrowing experience to have to tell your clients that something is broken. however i don't agree that you need to get into specifics of what is broken and who is going to fix it. because - in the long run - it is the company who is choosing vendors and if the vendor fails - i would go as far as saying that it is the companies fault for choosing a faulty vendor. Or at least not making sure that the vendor is doing it right/having backups and redundancy. 
  
  Whenever i have had large failures. I have tried to apoligize in the following form:
  
  Dear users. I am sorry for the downtime. We are working hard to fix it. I am sorry for any problems this has causes. 
  
  However - tumblr and 37signals seem to say stuff like:
  
  Dear users. Somebody caused us some problems and they are doing a poor job of fixing it fast. I am sorry for any problems this has causes. 
  
  Those two statements are VERY different. Which would you rather hear as a consumer? I would rather hear the first one.

  We do use PHP at Squidoo, but the framework is modelled after a Rails app. The architecture has allowed us to pull off some pretty crazy stunts (like ever.com) without major changes to the code base. PHP performance has been great...we're serving up 15m pageviews per month on only 3 commodity app servers. 
  
  I'm working on a side project which was built in Rails, and even with barely any data (meaning db isnt the bottleneck) we had to purchase a $350 per month slice from engineyard just to get it fast enough for production use. Sheesh.

  I grabbed the Wired that had just arrived and found your reference.  Just a small sentence :(  
  
  It's interesting that this doesn't seem to be true at all of the Ruby community, which has always come off to me as a fairly easy going and open to criticism.  But then Ruby lingered in obscurity for a long time with this kind of attitude.  Rails came out of the gate as aggressive and quite ready to insult competitors, and that's how it got attention and became big.  If DHH was more like Matz, Rails would probably be yet another Nice Framework No One Heard Of.  I guess it's not surprising that this set the tone for the community.  I also get the impression (though on this I'm much more vague, and might be wrong) that it's not just the attitude that has spread throughout the community, but also the strategy itself -- in the Rails community seem to be full of people jockying for status.  Zed's rant itself mirrors DHH's rants, though somewhat more epic and over the top than anything DHH has written.  After the Ghetto post, someone noted this post which made me start thinking this: http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2007/10/im-bad-im-nationwide-job-security-vs.html

  I am glad its small. I couldn't remember what i said - so i was a bit worried. haha. and thus the preemptive blog entry. heh. 
  
  I do agree with your experience with the Ruby community. They are like many of the obscure programming communities. At first, they seemed really excited to have people playing with them and in my experience this hasn't changed. They are still pretty chill and open to discussion.
  
  I never really thought about the fact that the rants are in fact mirroring each other. It really must be the koolaid that everyone is drinking. I do find myself drinking it as well - which is a bit annoying. 
  
  That is a pretty intense post. Its an interesting twist to the story for sure.

  Good post.  I just logged into my Mosso account earlier this week to do some site admin and noticed that I had a new graph - and that new graph was grossly unproportionate to my other 2 existing graphs (bandwidth and storage).  
  
  My new graph said that I had 500,000 requests of an allotted 3,000,000.  So I quick jumped on support chat and asked what was up and when this metric started calculating.  
  
  The answer?  5 days ago.  So it doesn't take a genius to figure out that I'm getting 100k hits a day, which would equal 3 million hits  a month.  I'm already at my limit ... and I don't even have any big sites.  Harper has 150 sites - I have 18 sites on my Mosso account that get hit.  Eighteen!  And I'm breaking their limits?
  
  One thing that might further point out how unrealistic this metric is, is if you look at my three metrics, storage, bandwidth, and requests.  I'm currently using:
  
  4.9% of my storage
  1.1% of my bandwidth
  20% of my requests
  
  What doesn't belong there?  Storage won't change with traffic and will grow slowly.  But the bandwidth and the requests metrics are completely dynamic and should probably be a little more proportionate to each other.
  
  Basically I'm getting penalized for using lite design with lots of little graphics instead of serving up videos and huge graphics?
  
  This metric is awful.  If it doesn't change, I'm leaving Mosso.

  Requests doesn't seem to be the best metric except for that requests does directly relate to memory and CPU usage which is really the metric that is where the cost really is. Comparatively speaking, bandwidth and disk usage are cheap. That's what the oversellers like dreamhost are all about. ;)

It's nice because we don't need anything on the level of Mosso or MT, just a good shared solution. Though since they use Rackspace it seems to give them the opportunity to help with more personal site tasks. We've had them help us out with setting up WordPress when we didn't have time and other mundane. So it's a nice level of service compared to others we've been with.

  Harper,
  
  It was cool meeting you both in Boulder and at SXSW. I was so glad you didnt bring the smells of Greeley with you... (I know we have no idea how to spell our company name correctly...)
  
  The frenetic pace of TechCocktail followed by SXSW makes it feel like I have been hanging out with the Tech crowd and partying for 5-6 days straight (wait, I suppose I was).
  
  Thanks for the shout out to Lijit, and I look forward to hanging out again, and I did I tell you about my tshirt idea? Oh, just submit it...power to the people, right? ;)

content: Harper, that makes sense.  Of course, a social graph is just a routing network (or 'federation' in some cases) and 'queues' just generalise presence and subscription -- think of making your (smtp) email buddy list into a twittergraph.  That is what AMQP can do, and why it is interesting.  I think XMPP is excellent also - they are quite complementary.

  Hi Dmitriy,
  Those are neat links. I haven't looked into them - but for what i am looking to use XMPP for, it isn't a queuing replacement. i think that a lot of people are looking to replace their messaging system with something like XMPP - and rabbitMQ may be a good option for them. For me, i want to work more in the data portabilty space - creating ways (using oauth and the like) for people to have their buddy list be their social graph. there is obviously more to it, but it is very much a topic that is interesting.

  Have you heard of AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) www.amqp.org and RabbitMQ as one of the implementations www.rabbitmq.com ?
  
  Can be good alternatives to XMPP as your transport.

  Harper, dude-man! You and Charlie were awesome. Funny, insightful, but probably a bit scary to the "old guard" who had sponsored the event. The way you guys looked and talked caused a spontaneous flashback to the dotcom era communication/generation gap (there's an old set of memories), where the sponsors and grayer types were saying WTF are these guys and WTF are these guys talking about. Hell, the Internet is Serious Business. RLY? RLY! This is no time to joke around.
  
  Thanks for tutelage in the Hummer--you forgot to blog about that! But I'll get to it in my next blog entry or two...
  
  And you are so right about politics on campus. They still can be very political places. But the real point, if I get it, is that speakers and profs are in positions of power and aren't supposed to use that position to favor one candidate over the other. It assumes that people are sort of sheeplike and easily hypnotized by speakers with big holes in their ears, shiny heads, or convincingly mesmerizing slides. But there it is.  Hope to keep in touch with you and Charlie and grab a beer in Chi-town with you soon. Vote for Obama!! And Go Cubbies Go!

  Harper, 
  
  Why couldn't you nab a cheap $50 xbox1, or old PS2? Don't both of those come with a optical out, and a remote option. Plus it could dubble as a cheap DVD player. And if you go thte Xbox Route, you could Softhack it (no mod chip required) and add Xbox Media Center (XBMC), which would give you a DivX player and a Upconverting DVD player as well as a Digital CD Player.

  I thought about that - the only problem i have is that i don't have a TV. so having something that depends on a monitor isn't really an option. I have looked into PS1 for that very reason - coax digital out and supposedly good sound. 
  
  for now i am going to stick with finding NEC external cdroms from the 90s. heh. 
  
  If i ever get a TV - the XBMC is probably what i will choose.

  Either your Oauth Token is incorrect or twitter is returning something mysterious.

content: Wow, this is a great review. I typically lug around 2-3 books in my bag to work because I like to read, but also because I like to mix it up. That said, there's something tangible about feeling a page and turning it. Maybe I'm just old. I'm not quite ready for a kindle yet. Also the idea that my book needs to be constantly recharged is a bit of a turn off.

content: My dream app for the Kindle is one that would take my unread feeds in Google Reader, turn them into reasonably well-formatted Kindle files, and deliver them to the Kindle, ideally automatically like those newspaper subscriptions you can buy from Amazon. Also it should sync back to Google Reader to mark items as read, sync tags, starred items, etc. If you built this app I would think that you were a very kewl dude.

  That would be very awesome. I have toyed with how to do this. I think one way would be to generate a PDF or something of X articles in the unread stream of google reader feeds and then email it to your kindle every morning. 
  
  It would be really awesome to have google reader hooked well into the kindle. I will look into it.

I can see the Kindle has being nice at night too - turning those pages laying in bed is so hard. Ah, so lazy.

  It took me a while to entirely realize that cloud servers aren't anything particularly fancy, they are just servers that you can bring up and take down with an API.  Once I realized that, the whole Mystery Of The Cloud disappeared, and it all seemed much more reasonable.  I'm still trying to figure out the workflow (hacking on some code at this very moment for that), but it doesn't feel too difficult.
  
  The hourly billing is really nice for testing; Linode does seem surprisingly faster than the other options, but the ability to bring up a server and tear it down for less than a dollar is really appealing.
  
  I do really wish I could use App Engine, but I've finally decided I just can't, I can't restrict myself to that set of features.  But I do kind of want to set up a deployment system similar to App Engine, but with more library options (and databases) and without bothering with the security constraints (using a full virtual server, with basic trust between all applications on the server).  I'm not sure exactly how this will turn out, but it seems doable.

  I recently stumbled onto the OpenBTS project myself and my mind wandered down a similar path as yours.  How cool would it be to run a neighborhood-wide cell network?  You could simply be a gateway to other phone numbers or even better, be your own completely separate network.
  
  The USRP2 is very cool.  Get some sector antennas in a few specific locations around town and backhaul via 5.8ghz P2P wifi links.
  
  So many ideas...

  Can an antenna be fashioned in the general shape/dimension/capability of a shopping cart? 
  
  Could these be provisioned to the homeless so that they can organically roll in and remediate local access dead zones or high service events within urban environments?
  
  Could they be able to collect a fair share of service fees?

  What really miss is a decent way to hook DECT phones upto a VoIP services without doing the analogue conversion - A few companies have some stuff (Siemens, Snom) and AVM do an all in one Fritz!Box but there still seems a gap.

  I can't believe you bought one so soon. You should know better than to jump on the iTrain whenever they release a new product. I'm not saying the iPad is worthless, but I am very dissapointed in Apple for not including obvious options because they want to have something to include to make you buy the v2. The saving graces for the iPad that I see are that it will be able to stream movies and tv through a hulu app, ( at least I think its hulu) and that when jailbroken the hardware alone will make it an awsome tablet type computer for the ability to have free applications and a real Mac OS.
  
  My end comment is that Apple is being super stingy with the options on and in the iPad, but once jailbroken it will be a wonderful platform.
  
  If somethign doesn't make sense it is probably due to me just finish a 3 hour drive back to school and it being 3am...

content: I, too, was pretty taken with my initial use of the device. I ran into the same problem with Google Reader and was very irritated. However, I did find a solution. It seems that the iPad requires a two-finger scroll gesture to scroll your right side feed list in Reader. Once I figured this out, it made the world of difference and I am back in business with reader again. Hope that helps.
