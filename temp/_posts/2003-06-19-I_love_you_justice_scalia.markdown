<a href="http://www.democrats.org/scotus/bushenstein.html">remember</a> to watch out. Bush is about to make a <a href="http://www.democrats.org/scotus/pryor.html">nomination</a> to the supreme. The proposed "man" is William Pryor, a young attorney general from alabama who has some alarming views; most alarming is his stance on minority voting rights, disabled person rights, <a href="http://www.million4roe.com">reproductive rights</a>, and prisonors rights. he is cool enough to want the ten commandments posted at every courthouse. His reasoning for becoming a lawyer was to fight the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">ACLU</a>. he is worse than super freedom fighter <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/3/21/35911/1828">Justice Antonin Scalia</a>. sad. yall should really visit <a href="http://www.million4roe.com">million4roe.com</a> and sign the petition. it seems to be a pretty good movement. and if we do get someone in the supreme court who is not anti-choice they will most liekely be someone who is pro-freedom and not pro-stupidity. meh. whatever.. ;)<br/><br/>check out these beatboxers.. heh. here is some <a href="http://www.humanbeatbox.com/videos/index.shtml">videos</a>, they are really good especially <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/elementary/front.htm">this one</a>. download <a href="http://www.humanbeatbox.com/audio/index.shtml">these mp3s</a>. Rahzel is amazing. seriously. how in the world. wtf. it is crazed and insane.<br/><br/>not as insane as <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/124/21.0.html">this</a> or <a href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/news/0619story3_news.shtml">this</a>.<br/><br/>what happened to the <a href="http://weblog.fuck.org">#LOST weblog</a>. so sad. there goes half my day. :(
