Ivan and I are in Santa Clara this week for the <a href="http://mysqlconf.com/">mysql conference</a>. We are going to learn how to make threadless so fast that it breaks hearts. That is really fast. We got here a bit earlier today and have been waiting for our rooms to become ready. The weather is great - about the same as Chicago and I think it will only get better as we stay here.

I am excited to see what the mysql peeps have to offer and it will be fun to hang out with the <a href="http://rackspace.com">rackspace</a> people as well. I think on Thursday, Ivan and I will be giving a tech talk at <a href="http://video.google.com/googleplex.html">Google</a> about skinnycorp stuff. So that should be interesting.

I will be updating with various thoughts and what not throughout the week. Especially if <a href="http://tangent.org/index.pl?node_id=506">something really cool</a> or <a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/item/628.cfm">exciting</a> strikes me.

If anyone is here as well - leave a comment and lets get together and get a drink or something. It should be fun. And we have <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/130/353765540_e7071fa52e.jpg?v=0">stickers</a>... oh so many stickers!

btw, It always cracks me up that santa can be rearranged into satan. heh.
