<br/><br/>i am going to add a del.icio.us plugin to my site soon. it should rule. then you all can see what I am lookign at. today for instance.. I looked at this amazing website about <a href="http://www.cowboybooks.com.au/html/acidtrip1.html">this guy who made drawings while tripping on acid</a>. it is incredible. experiments like this make me smile. I enjoy smiling. seriously. oh oh oh my <a href="http://www.colepierce.com">friend coles</a. site made me smile.
