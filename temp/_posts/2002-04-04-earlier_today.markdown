this morning whilst I was in the shower, I got to thinking about how anoying our media and its relationship with the government is. In one particular example: the whole enron thing. It seems that when clinton ran into some women problems, he was crucified - however when bush, cheney and the like get involved in a <a href="http://michaelmoore.com/2002_0129.html">complicated financial scam</a> the media as well as our elected leaders turn their collective eye. Why do you think this is? Is it because too many people are involved and linked to the Enron crash. Is it because th eEnron crash and its link to the privativation of everything may have caused the argentina crash.  Is it because they passed lots of legislation for enron and it would look poorly to come out and sya that the biggest lobby group was funded by criminals. oh right.. hehe.

I really think that bush wants to be known as the man who broke the world.
