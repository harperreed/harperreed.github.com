yep its true.  ihad blueberry soup last night. I cannot lie. it was tasty. a little out of control.<br/><br/>Do you want to be a <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/RockStarScenester">Rock Star Scenester</a>?<br/><i>Bush warns CEOs: 'You'll be exposed'</i> - I wonder if they will expose bush in the process of bush exposing them. I also wonder if <a href="http://rense.com/general27/becom.htm">more</a> people are starting to realize how screwed up <a href="http://rense.com/general27/goodbye.htm">bush is getting</a>. I certainly hope that the general population notices that he is a <a href="http://www.newyorkmag.com/page.cfm?page_id=6228">crook</a> and lets our <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-368297,00.html">lovely leaders</a> <a href="http://www.aclu.org">notice</a>. But we all know how people <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/29/afterlife.argument.reut/index.html">solve things</a>...<br/>It is always an interesting exercise to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/wn_report/story/7002p-6517c.html">compare</a> two presidents and there policies. especially when they are so different. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-368297,00.html">Here</a> is a surprise. But the U.S. would never let it stop at <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20262-2002Jul30.html">that</a>. We need to <a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20020730-051149-1275r">kill</a> <a href="http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/breaking_4.html">kill</a> <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,59055,00.html">kill</a>. And as if we didn't have enough problems getting caught up in our own propaganda mess.. bush wants to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18822-2002Jul29.html">create formal office to shape U.S. image abroad 
</a>. wtf. this guy is gunna get us all killed. and destroy a lot of the world in the process. I hope his friends are getting really really rich.
