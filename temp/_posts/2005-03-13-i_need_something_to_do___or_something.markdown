<p>so I was trying to learn how use cookies in csharp and I noticed that I always needed a cookie displayer - not one that shows what cookies are residing on the client - ut one that shows the cookies the page is sending to the client. so anyway. so I made one. it is called <strong>cookie destroyer</strong>:</p><p>check it out <a href="http://dopeman.org/cdestroyer/" target="_self">here</a></p><p>also there are pictures from last night <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A03%3A12_Crobar" target="_self">here</a>. I &quot;made&quot; the jacket I am <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A03%3A12_Crobar&img=IMG_3369.jpg" target="_self">wearing</a>&nbsp;- I had purchased the jacket at salvation army for 3.50 or something. then I took it to chicago. and cut off the edges of the jacket. then I stapled a HUGE skull on the back. it ruled. I had a bunch of people ask where I got it and comment on how cool it looked. I think I will do it again. and I will do some nifty stencil work on the next one. I am picturing pin stripes and airplanes. </p>
