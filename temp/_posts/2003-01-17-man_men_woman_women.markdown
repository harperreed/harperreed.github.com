Man - I have been writing this entry for so long. I keep reading <a href="http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=409865">this</a> post on fark about exam/test taking stories. Some of them are very funny. I wish I was in college again. so much fun was had. I found <a href="http://llama.cubio.fi/lesson.txt">this</a> to be humorous. and <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/education/extra/all.html">this</a> to be really screwed up. insane even.<br/>Apparently I have a fan in taiwan - hi ella. my <b>first</b> fan.. btw<br/>Last night I went to see the assasins. they are great. they got a little harder edged - which is wonderful. they are opening for zwan on wednesday. that rules. it is great when good things happen to cool people.. heh...<br/><br/>In the news today - <a href="http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1076778,00.html">saddam makes</a> a defiant speech about the "first" gulf war. He is pissed. so are a lot of <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=253359&contrassID=1&subContrassID=0&sbSubContrassID=0">others</a>... everyone is getting all crazy about this.. preparing for this and <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20030117-907642.htm">that</a>.. but no one is prepared for <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2003021955,00.html">this</a> - wtf. But no one can deny that saddam is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6081-2003Jan17.html">strangely in violation of something</a>... but there is still <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=597&e=18&u=/nm/20030117/tv_nm/television_simpsons_dc">hope</a>.. but not for this <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20030117055428478C700783">not so intelligent man</a>.
