So this weekend was the weekend of roomate house warming parties. It was fun. On friday I went and saw my friends band.. winnie. heh.. which is both the band and my friends name. They played with some other friends of mine.. Tallulah. heh. what a surprise. but anyway. so then after that I went to a friends house warming party. what a night. a bunch of people got naked and ran around.. mostly danced.. but whatever.. such a party. hehe. <br/><br/>Then on saturday.. I basically just hung around and lazed.. heh. it was great. utill around 8.. at which time we had a party - a sorta house warming party for our new roomate and a real house warming party for our neighbor. it was great to have a combined party. although I forgot to invite a bunch of people :( alas.. it was still fun. I saw a bunch of friends. and I feel it was a success.
<br/>then today.. a friend of mine had a BBQ at his house. it was a lot of fun. I really hope that we are able to juggle for some of these kids. it would be really great. oh. I almost forgot.. check <a href="http://www.enterprisemission.com/physics.html">this</a> out.... ... ...
