So I am in colorado.. hanging out with my parents and my brother. it is a lot of fun. I saw my cousins football game today. he did a good job. it is really funny watching little kids play sports. they do really funny things. COle is the quarterback.. so he got to play a lot.. and he is quite good. then we had a nice dinner.. and then I went to fort collins to see where dylan lives, works and hangs out. it was nice. his house is nice. we played a bunch of really dumb games at his work... and wasted a lot of money on STUPID STUPID thing.. haha<br/>afterward.. we were going to goto cactus canyon.. but we instead went to walmart and purchased estes rockets and lit them off in mikes subdivision.. it was a blast.. haha.. so much fun. I got good video..
