I just watched the beginning of this <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0342804/maindetails">awesome movie</a>. It was about this women Susan Tom who is raising 11 adopted children all with severe illness or handicaps. It is heart wrenching. I was sitting here trying to find something mindless to put on so i could work with the TV and BAM. sorrow. seriously though - if you have a chance, and a bunch of kleenex - check this movie out. so sad.

anyway. work work work.
