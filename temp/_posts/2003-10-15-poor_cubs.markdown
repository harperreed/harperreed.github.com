So last night I came home and hung out with matt.. then joanna and her friends from iowa city came and visited. we went to abril and hung out.. it was exciting cuz <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/harper/harper_and_friends/olden_days/36.jpg">laura</a> came.. I hadn't seen her in years.. we all went back to my house and got ready to go to wrigley field.. we got on the train.. and found out the cubs lost.. and then found out that the shortstop screwed up.. and that a <a href="http://image.inkfrog.com/pix/bigpeeler/Cubs___Priceless.jpg">stupid fan</a> <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qz79">screwed things</a> up as well. so it goes.. however.. when we got to wrigley.. the streets were INSANE. totally packed with sad people.. but we prevailed.. and hung out.. <br/><br/>hopefully they win tonight.. corigan is singing.. and a bunch of friends will be hanging out.. soooo.. we shall see..
