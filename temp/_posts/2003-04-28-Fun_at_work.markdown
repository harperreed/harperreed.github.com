Today work is fun. well sorta. we got smoe good stuff done. but now I am ready to go home. Some friends and coworkers sent me some good links. Noel sent <a href="http://www.channel4.com/gayometer">this gayness test</a> in.. I am apparently 46% gay. wow surprise there huh ;) one of my coworkers sent <a href="http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/merzo/">this "Starship Dimensions"</a> site to me. It is rather fun. Mostly because their are soooo many space ships.. <br/><br/>This weekend made me(and my brother apparently) want a miniDV cam. I think it would be fun. Right now I am happy using my digicams to capture the 30 seconds of crap video that they capture. But I want to ROCK.
