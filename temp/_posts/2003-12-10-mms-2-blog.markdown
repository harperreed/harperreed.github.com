I really like the idea of mobile blogging and haven't been too keen on using my keypad to do an entry on my blog. A friend showed me his <a href="http://bryan.textamerica.com/">moblog</a> that he made using his <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,2273,00.html">3650</a> and i thought that it couldn't possibly be that hard to create a similar thing using the mms message sent from the phone. As far as i can tell - the mms message is composed of fancy headers and then the payload as an attachment.

With this in mind i started looking at anti spam and email filtering scripts and wrote a script that extracts the MIME message from an email. This wasn't hard. so i hooked that into my blog and bam i got my own <a href="http://www.nata2.org/photolog.php">little moblog</a> - albiet it is kinda ghetto ;)

my only complaint is the speed it takes to upload the pictures ota.

<a href="http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fmms2blog&text=MMSemailFilter.0.3.pl">here is the link to the code.</a>  I use qmail so i had to reference the perl script in my .qmail file like:
<blockquote>.qmail:
| /wherever/your/script/resides/MMSemailFilter.pl</blockquote>
It works pretty good and has been fun to use.
