so I woke up this morning and the heater was on. it is not a cold day out. it is not hot. but it is nearish 60 or 70. but the heat really made it hot. heh. I was really confused. I woke up and turned my fans on. weird. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1086193222-Nokia6600%28845%29.jpg">here</a> is my brothers package I am about to send him. hehe. I am pretty excited. he better be too. or I iwll punch him in the nuts. <br/><br/>seriously though. I NEED to get my anna karenina back. I am trapped in this weird world of the russian country side - with horses and courts and vronsky's hospital. I NEED to finish it. seriously. KILLING me. something is about to happen. and I want to know what it is. <Br><br/>i am taking this week off from representing. haha.
