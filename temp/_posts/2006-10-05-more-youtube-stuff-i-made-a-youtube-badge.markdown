<a href="http://www.flashandburn.net/youtubeBadge/nata2/refer"><img align="right" src="http://flashandburn.net/youtubeBadge/nata2/recent.png" /></a>So i decided to copy the success of my <a href="http://www.flashandburn.net/youtubeBadge/nata2/refer">flickr badge</a> and create a <a href="http://flashandburn.net/youtubeBadge/">youtube badge</a>. It works really easy and shows the last 6 videos you have uploaded. Its pretty cool. I used the <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2006/10/02/some-quick-youtube-hackings/">youtube class</a> i made the other day and just copied the functionality straight across from my flickr badge. haha. its awesome when you code well (its actually a mess... sadly).

So check it out over at <a href="http://flashandburn.net/youtubeBadge/">flashandburn.net</a>. As far as i know - it is the first badge of its kind.

I have decided to place all my awesome and quick hacks over at flashandburn.net. I think its a decent place. In the last couple days i have created a programatic youtube gallery/videolist generator. Its pretty hilarious. I do like apis. It makes a lot of neat little gadgets able to be made. I have some ideas. I am thinking about making a JS include flickr gallery and or youtube gallery for your enjoyment. But nobody knows... Probably something silly.
wait and see.

Also - let me know if this badge works for you. I have only tested it sporadically.
