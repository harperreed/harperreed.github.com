so a week or so ago I went to this party for the <a href="http://www.chicagothong.org/">chicago thong organization</a>, it was really funny and strange - but my friend chris and I participated in the activities and wore thongs and capes(which was the costume of choice). well later that night we were at a club and one of our friends snapped this really great <a href="http://ambrel.net/android/images/IMG_1453.jpg">shot of my ass</a>. when I got to work on monday and saw it - I thought immediately how fun(and funny) it would be to send it to my parents in a really nice frame. so I did. it was killing me however - cuz I had to wait quietly in the corner and let them receive it without me blowing the surprise. so today they receieved it. ;) and here is my fathers response (via aim of course):

my family rules.<br/><br/>hopefully I will receive my <a href="http://danger.com/">sidekick today</a>. I am hopeing to <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/sidekick">hacking it</a> with the goal being to write some really nifty apps for it. mostly network security tools and blogging utils. I really like the idea of using it only for AIM. hah. I will continue to become a huge nerd. <a href="http://stuffthatisawesome.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/gatesmug.jpg">HUGE NERD</a>. speaking of random linking, check out my friend <a href="http://virtualdarts.typepad.com/">boone's new blog</a>. he has really taking to blogging with great style and <a href="http://www.studio7imaging.com/images/ultra_fractals/pizazz.jpg">pizazz</a> (that was a tribute link <b>;)</b>). I think I would like to write a small piece of code into my blog that will link to specific words I define with random images from googles image search. I think that would be entertaining.
