seriously. I was just sitting here at home waiting for things to happen. and BAM something happened. I got an email from minmouse@sbcglobal.net. heh. rule. here it is:
<blockquote><small>

I am apparently am going to wake up someone who I am not tomorrow - if I compare myself to that guy. hmm. weird. anyway. as john says: <blockquote><small>
<b>John E Toughguy:</b> Life is good when your only enemies have trouble putting actual sentences together. It makes things easier.</small></blockquote><br/><br/>yes I did break nata2.info. but hopefully things will come back together very very soon. I am migrating all my sites from the old server to the new server. it is hard. I was using apache 2.0 but then I read about the problems with threadsafe applications using not threadsafe plugins and extensions. so apache and php(both threadsafe) may work fine - but gd or freetype may destroy life. so I downgraded apaches and upgraded phps. not hp 5 yet. but at least the newest version. so anyway. check out <a href="http://nata2.info">nata2.info</a> in a bit and hopefully it will work. I lov emy DESTROYER way of upgrading. it rules. RULES. <br/><Br>i am sickly.

i need to restructure everything and it will be the same.
