<p>The other night i was somehow able to see Michael Moore's new movie: <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/trailer/">Sicko</a>. It was amazing. Really sad and funny at the same time. It told me what i already knew - but added a bunch of person touches to it as well. </p> <p>One thing it mentioned that I didn't know - was that Cuba is a mecca for good medicine and is involved in bringing medicine to a lot of other third world countries. </p> <p>I think if Hiromi or I ever get sick we will move to japan. hah. </p> <p>You might still be able to <a href="http://www.mininova.org/tor/750952">download the movie</a> and check it out. You should. Or just wait until its out and go with me to see it in the theatre. It will be fun to watch with a bunch of people. A bunch of soon to be very angry people.  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:ebbd6702-656c-44b3-b3d5-18482a1548e7" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]sicko, michael moore, sad, health care, movies[/tags]</div></p>
