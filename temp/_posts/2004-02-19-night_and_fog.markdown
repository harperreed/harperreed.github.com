last night morgan and I watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0048434/">night and fog</a> - a really good documentary on the horrors of the german concentration camps in europe during world war II. It was the first time I had seen actual movie footage of all the bodies and such. it was quite haunting. I am not a fan of genocide. I thought that the end of the documentary was quite appropriate - with the message that the enemy is "us." <br/><br/>i am sad that I haven't had the time or patience to really write a good solid blog entry. lately I have been so busy at work that I don't usually have time to sit and write out an entry - so I open this editing dialog and then it sits for 5 hours.. this is probably why my blog seems like it is written by a crackhead.  alas.. I will attempt to schedule more time to blogging ;)
