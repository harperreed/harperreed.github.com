heh. it sucks. all of my coworkers are gong to be sad. hopefully they will get over it soon. stupid sports. we should have never let them breach the level in our lives wherre they effect our emotions.. but then if they didn't.. what good would they be. I think sports prepare us for war and conflict. whatever beowulf...<br/><br/>we have got to elect someone better for president in 2004. <br/><br/>so I have been getting up far earlier than before.. and for the last two weeks.. I have had time to hang out a bit before work. it is strange. I mean.. I am tired.. but I am also playing around. I wish others were up with me. I need to buy a house..
