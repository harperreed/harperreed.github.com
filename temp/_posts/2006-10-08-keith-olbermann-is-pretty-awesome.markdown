<p>I am not a fan of the current administration. In fact you could say that I really despise the current leadership of the United States. It is frustrating and annoying. I get so angry that I stop reading the news. Then I get angry and I have to get caught up. Then I get angry from reading the news. Its a vicious vicious cycle. </p> <p>So anyway. A couple months ago I got rid of my cable. Nobody was really helping me pay and I wanted to get rid of it anyway. so I just did it. hah. The only thing I miss is the daily show and some other good news programs. So in the last couple weeks I have been looking for a way to download the shows I want to watch (more on this later) and through this journey I discovered Keith Olbermann. And his owning of the president, media and others that drive me batty. </p> <p>I compiled a list of some great videos over at <a href="http://geopoli.com/">geopoli.com</a>. Check them out: <a href="http://geopoli.com/videos/Countdown+with+Keith+Olbermann/">Countdown with Keith Olbermann</a>. My favorite is "Olbermann's finest hour." So good. </p> <p>yea yea yea. liberal crap. I don't care. its good. and Olbermann is correct.</p>
