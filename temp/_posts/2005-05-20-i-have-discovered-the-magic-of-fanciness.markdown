So i discovered peapod tonight. in my quest to save money while preparing for my eventual demise at the hands of my EVIL DARK OVERLORDS i have been attemptign to not spend money on stupid things. like 15 dollars for dinner a night. so i have been investing in groceries to get my cooking back on. so tonight i discovered peapod. soon i will ownz you all - and i will have a full belly. full of cheese impregnated hostdogs!!! I WILL RULE THE WORLD.
