this weekend ruled. On friday I got my hair done and hung out with severn and some friends.. we got tacos and generally chilled. I then went to bed. it was awesome I love sleeping. So saturday we went to six flags to  juggle for the mardi gras event. I don't understand how mardi gras happens in august.. but whatever. the show was pretty laid back. just matiss and I juggling.. doing our general street performing show. it was fun... after that I went to the art and science party and then some random hipster party. it was really nice. I crashed.. woke up.. ate food.. and then I went to see MAIDEN. MAIDEN was awesome. seriously awesome.. I was worried that since they are old - it was going to suck. but no. they bounced around the stage like monkeys.. it was awesome.
