I got all my computers yesterday. I think I got some more work. which leads to more computers. which leads to more work. or something like that. Yesterday .. I went and played with the <a href="http://heracles.cuties.org/~phunk/gary.jpg">smallest cat</a> in the world. I want a <a href="http://heracles.cuties.org/~phunk/gary-sleeping.jpg">kitten</a>. I like kittens. they are so nice.. <br/><br/>so anyway.. my computers. the laptop is so so so small. it will be nice to have around. I gotta set up the WLAN so that I can surf porn in the kitchen(eep) or whatever. I am afraid that the range will be rather poor. I also need to get a case for it. I don't really feel comfortable just throwing it in my bag willy-nilly.<br/><br/>I need to remember to install an operating system on my desktop.. I think I want to put xp on the desktop and 2k/gentoo linux on the laptop. but in the meantime I need to check out this <a href="http://www.blkviper.com/WinXP/service411.htm">page</a>
