so I was listening to NPR the last night during dinner.. and they mentioned how some people were critical of the Bush administrations label of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/06/12/dirty.bomb.suspect/index.html">Jose Padilla</a> as a combatant. what is interesting, is that it appears that the suspect may not have be all he could have been.. and now the bush administration is struggling. After September 11th and allowing the country to fall into "war" I think the bush administration. is trying to show its ability in terms of security. whatever. <br/><br/><a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=304437">apparently</a> the US's accusal and subsequent  arrest of Jose Padilla has pissed off numerous other "friendly" nations. Why is it that our government is digging a hole for it self. Check out the <a href="http://rense.com/general25/finalde.htm">video</a> of bush reading to kids on sept. 11th. I love how our fearless leader is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/06/12/bush.terror/index.html">completely and utterly scared</a><br/><br/>on a lighter note.. check these sites out:<br/><a href="http://www.prahlad.org/pub/bearden/scalar_wars.htm">Scaler wars</a><br/><a href="http://www.thisistherealtruth.net/">the real truth</a><br/><a href="http://xfacts.com/x.htm">the return of planet x</a><br/><a href="http://www.hollowplanets.com/">hollow planets!!</a><br/><a href="http://www.soulinvitation.com/enki/">??</a><br/><a href="http://zapatopi.net/afdb.html">my favorite hat</a> - btw, this is one of the funniest site si have seen in some time
