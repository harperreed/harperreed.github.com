after walking to work. I noticed that I generally feel pretty good - in regards to the stiffness and all the reasons I went to accupuncture. that seems pretty cool. <Br><br/>on the elevator up to work there was a sign on the thirteenth floor that had a biohazard symbol and a birthday cake. I wasn't able to read it - I was confused by the combination of those icons. maybe not so much confused as I was worried. heh. umm. biowarfare cakeclass. that is the name of my new band btw. I am gunna play guitar. <br/><br/>this whole gay marriage thing is stupid. I don't understand how bush and "the republicans" can be so pigheaded and stupid. how can they actively be supporting such a segregationist movement. it is <a href="http://conelrad.com/">pretty insane</a>. a couple good links: <a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net/mt/archives/001544.php">wil wheatons writeup</a> and then <a href="http://www.oneeyedcult.com/archives/000036.html"> Cult of the One Eyed Cat</a>. both argue that the government shoudl not be involved. I guess it ust demonstrates the need to remove general religious morality from our government leadership. this should not be a truth issue - this shoudl be an issue of rights. a social issue - not a morality issue. another interesting way to look at this situation is to take into consideration the <a href="http://www.corante.com/importance/archives/002111.html">The Anti-Miscegenation Amendment</a> - which is an amendment from 1912 that attempted to abolish interracial marriage on the ground that it is "<i>..abhorrent and repugnant. It is subversive to social peace. It is destructive of moral supremacy..</i>" awesome eh. <b>;)</b> I think the point that can be taken from this - is that we all look at 1912 and see this ammendment and we think "how ridiculous, they were insane and obviosuly racist" - and then we think how silly and backwards the people who created the ammendment are. but what is missing - is that bush and his henchmen are the same people. they are conservative, upperclass white people - attempting to sell the voters out to big business. they are not caring about the actual issue. they are caring about whether they will continue being in public office - and what the means are to maintain that power: i.e. money.  now I don't think that it is just a money/corporate/lalala issue - it is obviously based on some "moral truth" that is "wrong" hahaha. what I mean to say is that there is a "moral truth" backing this new anti gay marriage ammendment that is appealing to a lot of americans - regardless of the social and segragationist implications. since <a href="http://godlovesfags.com/">god hate gays</a>, <a href="http://liberalslikechrist.org/gopvsgay.jpg">godlovers hate gays</a>. truth is hard to defeat and bush knows this. I am rambling a bit. heh. however I guess my overall point is that we need to keep in mind the viewpoint of disallowing any social/economic/ethnic/sexuality/etc group of people from doing ANYTHING is segragationist and is a process of creating a subclass of human. it seems that this is somethign that the US is constantly trying to combat around the world - how are we gogn to let this happen here? bush is dumb.
