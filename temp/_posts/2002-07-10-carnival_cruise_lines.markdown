once again theree is a carnival in front of my house. it is quite strange. rather confusing really. I don't think I ever imagined waking up to the wonderful sounds of the carnival. but whataver.. heh. tonight I went to innjoy to see my friends brock and amanda dj. they are nice deejays. they play electro, which is becoming fun to listen to.
