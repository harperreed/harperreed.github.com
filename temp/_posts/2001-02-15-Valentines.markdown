I had a valentine for this years valentines day. It was really neat. I never expected myself to become interested in romance. I like it though. I have never before felt this way about anyone. It is crazy. Valentines day was incredible. it was fun, romantic and all that.. <br>
On another note, i am in a fun fun electronics course. I wrote an oscilliscope/function-generator for a digital acquisition board we use. Fun fun. it was like playing with barbies. I think i am going to add an option to this journal that would encypt an entry if i want it to. that way i don't have to be so weary of what i post. well anyway..
