Happy thanksgiving!

It has been a long and lazy day today. Pretty awesome.  We are about to head out to a party at our friend Jill's house. it should be fun. There were so many options this year. Quite a <a href="http://callmejeffrey.com/">few</a> <a href="http://morefishthanman.com/">people</a> offered to include us in their families thanksgiving - it was a hard decision. I just picked the first one. haha. (and hopefully the one with the best food - as the hosts are all chefs at various places around the city).

Friends are awesome.

We miss our families, but will see them soon.

So happy thanksgiving to everyone.
