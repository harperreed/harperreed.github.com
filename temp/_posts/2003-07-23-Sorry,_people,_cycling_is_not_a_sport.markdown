as per usual.. a bunch of stuff is happening...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/wire/US/reuters20030723_3.html">North Korea</a> has given a date to the U.S. to resolve its problems with N. Koreas nuclear arms.. woah.. I guess we should really <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/942734.asp?0dm=T14QT">learn about earth</a> before the N. koreans and the U.S. <a href="http://www.trumpetersmission.com/faqrev1998.html">blow it up</a>.. <br/><br/>the weapons inspector from the U.K. that killed himself.. is shown in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1004177,00.html">a tape</a> criticising blair's need for evidence to support his false claim of WMD in Iraq. <Br><br/>heh.. and even Bill Clinton is siding with Bush about his <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/07/23/clinton.iraq.sotu/">apparent mistake</a> in the state of the union. wtf. didn't he lie.. I guess clinton is just happy that bush <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45241-2003Jul11.html">really</a> is in a free fall.. <br/><br/>so there is this attacker in wicker park.. it is insane.. but apparently the police released a report that stated that the attacked <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-cube23.html">looked like ice cube</a>.. ice cube isn't very happy. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.furnituresociety.org/cs/jul2003/newyork.html">here is some interesting furniture</a>.. angela jolie should probably <a href="http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30500-12382150,00.html">get some</a>.. furniture.. <br/><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/tow.htm">these</a> are the missiles which supposedly killed the Hussein sons. <br/>Scientists are saying that we should all <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/health/story.jsp?story=426768">become vegan</a>... so <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/world/2007360">sad</a>...<br/><br/>anyway..
