<a href="http://dylanreed.org">Dylan</a> is driving me and <a href="http://photodork.org">Sarah</a> to my grandfathers house, as I write this. its pretty funny that technology has brought us this far. I cant wait to see the future... again. so traveling is fun. but flying is so damned annoying. the security checkpoints are really ineffective and just cause problems. seriously - what good is it doing to limit the number/size of the toiletry carry on. I mean wtf. so annoying. the terrorist have won when we are unable to bring hair product on a plane with us.

my thumbs are tired. I am still getting used to this mini computer. I wish it had GPS... then I could geotag this article.
