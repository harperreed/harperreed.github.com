So I am now at work. Vacations are nice. some would say vacations are kick ass. I woudl tend to agree. The last couple days have been a DVD binge. I purchased 19 dvds from my brothers hollywood video store and got 11 from hong kong. I am excited. Soon I will have to make a dvd database so you can all peruse my dvd collection. I also plan on buying a new tv soon.. probably a wega. but I don't know.. ifyou have suggestions.. send em my way.<br/><br/>

while everyone was paying attention to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/08/06/conjoined.twins/index.html">nothing</a>.. the <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/story.jsp?story=321916">world</a> has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,769851,00.html">rejected</a> the US plan to attack Iraq. but thankfully.. <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=544&amp;u=/ap/20020806/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_medical_2&amp;printer=1">our leader is handling it ok</a>.. <br/>
<br/>

And apparently <a href="http://rense.com/general27/canned.htm">Monfort is still bad</a>.<br/> but the <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B415DC9C0%2D455B%2D43B7%2DA32B%2DFF32C0A1B655%7D&amp;siteid=yhoo">market</a> is coming back.
